# DETECTING EMOTIONS IN PATIENT DRUG REVIEWS: A Machine Learning Approach to Sentiment Analysis

This Bachelor's Thesis explores how machine learning can be used to classify sentiment in drug reviews written by patients. The goal was to predict whether a review is positive or negative using two classic models: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). To prepare the text for the models, two common feature extraction methods, Bag of Words and TF-IDFâ€”were used.
The results showed that SVM with TF-IDF gave the best overall performance. This study demonstrates that even simple, interpretable models can be very effective for real-world healthcare applications, especially when paired with proper preprocessing. The project also highlights opportunities for future improvements, like adding a neutral sentiment class or testing more advanced models such as BERT.
