12 Hour Nasal Decongestant Spray,For Nasal Congestion,19-Aug-22,Breat...,Taken for 1 to 2 years,Actually I use the generic brand of the 12 hour nasal spray. I'm not addicted! My nose is! Probably because it's worth the nasty taste to breathe freely again. The generic is a mere (maybe was) $1.88 + tax per bottle. I actually dilute the bottle with a 50/50 purified water. Works great. Doesn't burn and cost pennies.,319,10,0;;

5-HTP,For Anxiety,9-Jun-19,Calep...,Taken for less than 1 month,I have been suffering from severe panic disorder depression and anxiety for over a decade. I have tried different antidepressants and they only made it worse. I was at the lowest point I've ever been and I finally decided to give 5HTP a shot. I took 50mg yesterday afternoon and another 50 mg before bed. I woke up this morning happy. I can't even describe how incredible that feels to me. Everything is normal now. I'm not afraid of people. I'm not afraid to go outside anymore. I no longer feel like I need to self-medicate with alcohol just to cope and I am no longer suicidal. Everything is gone. But I'm still here. I highly recommend this just to make sure you do your research or talk to a doctor.,704,10,217;;

I tried anti depressants only a couple times on and off again when I felt desperate or overwhelmed only too make me feel even worse. I was extremely tired all the time pissed off at everything became less social eating more and just never feeling a day of happiness without really trying. Until 5-HTP. For me it has worked wonders in just 24 hours of many years of not feeling right. I wake up and feel good! I am not tired one bit. I feel human again.

I've been on a series of antidepressants over the last 5-6 years but could never reconcile the side effects with the minimal improvements I got from the medications.

5-HTP,For Anxiety,13-Apr-20,BASIL,Not Specified,Have had anxiety for as long as I can remember. Always nervous and in a fearful state. Facing my fears did not help.The only relieve I got from anxiety was when I exercised and afterwards for couples of hours. I had a gut feeling it was a chemical balance and tried numerous natural aids some helped a little. Then I tried 5 htp 100 mg and my anxiety was gone. I take 50 mg 3 times per day. As someone who was using benzos on and off for15 years I tapered off using niacinamide and l theanine then finally came across 5 htp. 5 HTP is better than benzos for me. Better mood and no anxiety.,588,9,87;;

I also suffer from depression and when I went on the depo birth control shot both mental illness were the worst they have ever been even my husband became concerned and spent hours a day researching ways to get me up and about again. I would spend my entire day in bed and the shot also caused me to gain 30lbs which distroyed any self esteem I had left. A customer and friend suggested 5-htp and I'm never looking back! I can enjoy life again I can feel and I'm not having anxiety attacks from leaving my house any more. I've also lost 10lbs. It works!,745,7,151;;

5-HTP,For Anxiety,16-Jun-19,TKahler,Taken for less than 1 month,I was at Walgreen's buying some Melatonin to help me sleep and I just happened to see the bottle of 5 HTP in the same section advertising anti-anxiety properties. I was skeptical but decided that it was worth the 20 bucks to see if it would help alleviate my anxiety issues. I was teaching a class that night and took one of the 5 HTP pills (50 mg) and kind of forgot about it. Several hours had passed and I was on my way home from said class and realized I felt pretty good and relaxed and then remembered the pill I had taken. I was still skeptical however and decided to try another one the next day and I got the same feeling. It's not a tired or groggy feeling it's actual relief from anxiety and it really works. The only drawback is it can cause your stomach to churn a bit when you first start taking them so make sure you take them with food.,852,9,93;;

5-HTP,For Anxiety,15-Nov-19,Aano,Not Specified,Wanted to share my experience with 5-HTP in case it helped anyone. I've used 50mg once daily for the past few years to help with depression/anxiety/sleep issues and it did help for a while especially with sleeping better. Unfortunately I now have to stop after realizing it has been making symptoms worse after taking it probably too long. Too much serotonin in your system will cause worse anxiety so just know that just because this product is sold in the health food section - I would definitely consider it a natural drug you should do your research on. If the dose is too high it will cause worse anxiety issues. This drug can also interact with other medications and alcohol so just be aware. Buy a brand with good reviews and figure out what time of day taking it works best for you. It made me a bit too relaxed to take it in the morning but taking it right before bed caused crazy dreams,896,7,83;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,1-Jul-19,T G,Taken for less than 1 month,33 year old male. Started having nocturnal anxiety attacks. Happened for a couple weeks. Would wake up after falling asleep (usually with a late meal) not being able to breath chest pain feeling heavy and weak. I actually went to the ER the first night it happened because I thought I was dying. Doctor originally thought the issue was caused by stomach acid getting into lungs but antacids did nothing. Doctor then suggested 5 HTP a week later. No more attacks (other than the one night I forgot to take the pill) after I started taking 100mg before bed. If you plan on taking 5HTP get quality product (don’t go cheap trying to save a dollar). Some of the lower quality stuff can have its own side effects. Good luck.,718,10,77;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,2-Feb-17,Solveig,Not Specified,I am 24 and have suffered from depression and severe anxiety since I was a young teenager. I've attempted suicide and been on tons of antidepressants which didn't help. My brother researched natural medicine and found this to treat his depression plus st johns wort in the mornings and I decided to try it per his recommendation. So glad I found this. I finally feel like life is worth living and have hope in the future again. I take the 5-htp at night because it knocks me out and gives me vivid dreams. I only take 100mg daily.,530,10,105;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,13-Aug-12,Anonymous,Taken for 1 to 6 months,Switched from Seroquel 50mg/Prozac 20mg/ to just 50mgs of 5-HTP at night.

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,6-Nov-17,Carbear,Not Specified,I have been on anxiolytics and antidepressants for 15 years. I wanted to give them up and go natural. I must say I can not believe it has not been recommended to me before! I guess it's because it takes away from their business. My first 200 mg dose I became a little nauseous but I hadn't eaten before taking it. I am amazed at how my mood has improved. I also used to smoke marijuana and when I stopped I missed the way it gave me patience with my children. I would smoke and all of the sudden the messes and yelling didn't bother me. Unfortunately it's not legal in texas so I needed to stop. After two months of irritability I have now found some thing natural and legal that gave me my patience back and my children their loving mother back!,746,10,94;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,24-Aug-18,Anonymous,Not Specified,5HTP has helped me manage my anxiety and after years of PTSD related nightmares I'm finally sleeping properly. It's helped massively with suicidal ideation even during better times the intrusive thoughts were always lurking. For the first 7-10 days I did have quite noticeable side effects headaches feeling nauseous and shaking a little but I continued to take it as TBH it was better than side effects of prescribed anti depressants I've experienced in the past  which is probably not the most sensible but now I'm happy I did. I take this with a combination of L-tyrosine and B vitamins and magnesium. Probably also worth mentioning is the ease I've managed to sort out my binge eating I've lost 13kg in the last 4 months which has been a fantastic thing for me and now my BMI is back in the healthy range.,809,9,81;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,9-Apr-20,Nutty...,Taken for 10 years or more,5-HTP in my experience of taking it (10yrs+) It has absolutely been down to dosage.. I have had terrible side effects with the lowest Recommended Dosages. Sweats/Shakes/Anxiety through the roof/Nightmares/Insomnia... Until I started at the lowest dose I could buy 50mg Slow/Timed Release type in the morning & had no unwanted side effects.. I have increased my dosage to 100mg daily if having a bad episode & usually after say 6wks- 3 months I have gradually reduced back down to 50mg over 2-3wks- ie: Taking 100mg Mon-Wed-Fri-Sun & 50mg on the other day's then 50mg for 2 days & 100mg on the 3rd day & so on...Obviously I am not a medical professional I am just sharing my experience here...I suffer from PTSD/Depression/Anxiety & 2 out of my 3 pregcies ended in serious episodes of PND..(Suicidal Psychosis) I self medicated for many years & been prescribed many Anti-Depresants/Anti-Psychotics all of which have given me the worst side effects listed.,954,10,59;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,21-Jun-15,Hugh...,Not Specified,Supplements vary wildly in potency and quality from brand to brand. The way this stuff works for me is to put 50 mg of powder into a quart of water and drink it throughout the day.

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,28-Sep-15,zeden,Taken for 1 to 6 months,Just want to add this has been great. I was on citalopram but became too much of a problem for me having to go to the doctors every month and having work. Getting this delivered to my door was so much easier. Been taking 100mg every night before bed its reduced my anxiety quite a bit. I'm still on a benzo for the time being but what people here have to understand this drug works with chemicals in you brain. This is the reason you get increased anxiety. When I started citalopram my anxiety went through the roof before improving my condition after about 8 weeks. Let it ride through and take it at night at first it will increase your anxiety,646,10,90;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,26-Feb-16,Dizzie-,Taken for less than 1 month,Don't take this with benzos made me extra drowsy and anxious. One pill I only took half of one pill (50mg!). I got some kind of adverse reaction. My insomnia got worse I got panic attacks shivering tremor felt disorientated and seriously more depressed. Now I have woken up in the middle of the night for many nights to same feeling: anxious cant fall asleep again. I regret taking this. And I said once again: DONT MIX THIS WITH BENZOS and be careful if your nervous system is sensitive you are sensitive to supplements or you suffer from bad insomnia cause it can cause paradoxical reaction. Start with tiny doses to find out whether this is the right supplement to you. For me it definately is NOT. This supplement also has many side effects,744,1,84;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,25-May-20,blue-...,Taken for less than 1 month,Took a 50mg pill for the 2nd time. (1st time I took it I felt weird but wasn't sure). This medicine actually increases my anxiety a lot and I feel very anxious and nervous.,172,1,44;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,10-May-20,Summer,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I have had great results using 5HTP for anxiety and panic. I have a couple different blends with the 5HTP B6 L Theanine and one for night with melatonin they are both 50 mg and I usually only take 1/2. It tends to make me calm and tired so I prefer night dose but that night dose seems to keep me calm and in a much better mood all of the next day. I have had no side effects other than needing a nap after taking 100mg. It starts working quickly like 1/2 hour. I do find that after 2-3 weeks it tends to quit working so I take a week off then start again.,556,9,43;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,1-Mar-17,Aldoyle,Taken for less than 1 month,This stuff works great! For people that get sick or anything I'm just going to tell you most likely you got serotonin syndrome from it because of too much of the chemical in your system and that is dangerous so be careful. I do note that it makes me sleep super well but the grogginess tends to linger around and I need a couple cups of coffee to cut through it. That being said I have that niarvana feeling of calmness and clarity. My mood and motivation is improved massively as well. I had especially hard times with waking up and getting started in anything that includes things I love doing and finishing things after taking this it right away really sparked up my missing link. I will probably get st. Joins wort for tolerance breaks.,740,10,72;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,27-Apr-17,5htp,Taken for 1 to 2 years,It has been the only thing that has relieved my symptoms of depression and anxiety and possibly my pain.

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,28-Feb-20,BigTrev,Taken for less than 1 month,I been suffering from PTSD and severe anxiety issues. The doctor put me on mirztapine at 15mg to help which it did. Saying that I was so determined to get off this nasty antidepressant because of weight gain even tho I run 30 miles a week. So silly me started taking 200mg of 5htp for 2 days. I have ended up with really bad palpitations and anxiety because of the two 200mg of 5htp and antidepressants giving me serotonin syndrome. Can someone tell me when is it safe for me to go back on my mirztapine again and how long will it take for 5htp to leave my system. Day 2 after taking 5htp and very anxious still shallow breathing etc. My doctors are useless and don't even know about 5htp. Maybe friends from across the pond can guide me better.,745,4,40;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,24-Jan-21,Milie,Taken for 5 to 10 years,I take 150 mg of 5HTP twice a day for many years. It has helped me with depression anxiety and insomnia. Great product. It can be used as an antidepressant without giving me a foggy brain. I take Serotone by Apex Energetics which includes 5htp and other good ingredients for depression anxiety and insomnia.,307,9,31;;

First three days it helps with my insomnia nice 7-8h sleep but no change with anxiety or mood then I started waking up at 3am sweaty with elevated heart rate and having very vivid bad dreams and it continued during the day with tension headache and severe anxiety and depression didn't know 5-htp causing it so I continued taking it. Things get worst to the level that I,399,1,26;;
5-HTP ,For Insomnia,26-May-16,sirius,Taken for less than 1 month,I take 5-htp for both insomnia and anxiety .The benzos and other meds didn't work anymore . So I've started to take 100 mg of 5-htp at night with a bit (7.5 mg) of mirtazipine and bang  gone for the WHOLE night. Incredible. I was so happy after searching for a remedy for years. I've started to take some small doses of 5 htp during day time ( 50mg at noon) and my anxiety is down. Now I have to let go the ATIVAN slowly but surely for my daily anxiety because it is now useless so I just have to figure out the right dosage and hope to use only this and nothing else for my sleeping problem and anxiety. ( don't forget the vitamin B6 to make it work better) So I went from a bunch of pills at night to almost nothing :-),721,9,63;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,12-Apr-19,Sad,Not Specified,Took 5 HTP 100 mg at night with magnesium to calm my mild anxiety and sadness help with sleep. I was post concussion and being treated for autoimmune disease. At around 6 months I increasingly noticed I was waking at night I started getting more anxious suicidal thoughts . During this time I also did a small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) treatment,358,1,42;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,31-Jan-22,Dont...,Not Specified,This stuff is seriously dangerous!! I do a lot of research before I try new things as my body is very sensitive to all supplements drugs vitamins etc. I bought the Jamieson brand which indicates the daily dose is 300mg a day I started with 25mg a day and was only on it for a week until I had to stop taking it. My whole body is now in severe pain (muscles joints) I get winded just from walking and can’t catch my breath. This is serious it does cause Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome (EMS) and I’m 99% positive that I now have that. Be careful with this!! And people with an autoimmune disorder or asthma should definitely stay away from it.,640,1,18;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,7-Sep-20,Anony...,Taken for less than 1 month,I took 5-HTP for the first time when I was feeling terribly depressed but it only made me feel even worse. Tried it again the same thing happened. How different reaction can be when it's applied to different people. : (,219,1,29;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,27-Jan-14,Anonymous,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,It seemed to help a bit at first but after taking it for almost a year the positive effects seemed to have disappeared completely. If you suffer from an anxiety disorder I would seriously recommend a prescription medicine. I've recently been switched to Buspar and it works wonders and is very cheap.,300,3,70;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,18-Oct-20,Lyla,Taken for less than 1 month,I’m a 51 yo female with a long history of anxiety and depression. With menopause just around the corner there are days my anxiety is off the charts. About 6 months ago I started taking 100mg daily. I was also having moderate to severe panic heart palpitations sweating and severe vomiting. I didn’t make the connection to 5HTP until I recently started taking it again. This time only 25mg. Same symptoms but milder. I cannot be 100% sure but I’m making the connection to this supplement. If you’re thinking of taking thus supplement I highly recommend talking to a holistic health practitioner first. Not to be dramatic but my episodes landed me in the ED three times last year. It was quite scary.,698,1,28;;
5-HTP ,For Insomnia,17-Aug-16,Econut,Not Specified,I've struggled with sleep-onset insomnia for 15+ years. It started in my early forties when perimenopause hit. Tried 5-HTP recently and after 2 weeks I'm sleeping great! I take 200 mg time-release an hour before bed. Also drink milk/buttermilk before bed. And gelatin mixed with hot water and juice earlier. I only take Ambien or Ativan when I still can't get to sleep but that's unusual. Since I'm sleeping sounding again like when I was younger my energy level is back to normal and I feel great again! I also changed my diet to low sugar/ high fiber. 5-HTP is a life saver to me!!!,584,10,52;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,13-Sep-18,gbgould,Taken for less than 1 month,Just started and noticed the difference overnight. No more stomach churning or ulcer like pain. Was tested for ulcer- negative. Feeling relaxed and a lot smoother. A little dry mouth and I,188,9,40;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,19-Feb-17,Inten...,Not Specified,It's caused mixed rxn often awake and cannot return to sleep. Foggy feelings during the day with occasional odd sense of impending doom. Anxiety that keeps me indoors...But when I decide to go out despite odd feelings I find myself to be strangely aggressive. It's a seems that I'm less tolerant to other people. For example there is a cashier who is always rude a real eye roller with frequent head shaking and sighs. Well after she rolled her eyes at me for asking for a pen she reluctantly smacked down on the counter. I tossed it at her after using it. Hmmm this is odd behavior for me I usually don't react to other people like that..So I've decided to quit this 5- Htp for now. I could end up doing something that gets me on the news,739,4,49;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,24-Nov-19,Tinodog,Taken for less than 1 month,I recently lost my job and going through stress. For about three weeks now I've been taking Ativan for sleep because the anxiety was keeping me up at night. I do not want to get addicted to the benzo.,200,7,31;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,2-Feb-19,perle...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,Combined with therapy I can almost say for sure that 5-HTP helps me. After a really painful breakup I was having looping suicidal thoughts (the thought of a gun going bang all the time) and was in a really sordid mood overall. A week or so into taking 100mg 3x daily I felt I was going better although I didn't necessarily think 5-HTP had played a role (I'm kind of skeptical person). I thought my improving mood was 100% due to a therapy with someone who really cares. I finished my 1-month supply bottle and stopped taking. Within a day or two my mood mysteriously took a hard hit. Just today I bought a new bottle. I'm pretty sure it'll help me again. I can't compare to big pharma meds because I never took them. I take this combined with Omega-3. I like the fact that there are 0 side effects for me. I'll continue taking 5-HTP at least for a while. 5-HTP isn't especially cheap but it's worth a try if your symptoms are really messing with your life.,956,8,36;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,5-Jan-16,Oneho...,Not Specified,Been using timed release 200mgs for last month and used to 400mgs daily. Slight stomach and headache issues but gone after first week. Works very well but need to buy a quality product. I paired this with Niacinamide 1500-2000mgs this is all medicinal level and it's working nicely with slight mood swings. My sleep is better with higher dose and I'm not suffering major panic attacks. I'm off Seroquel for now and this is working for my seasonal depression and I am bipolar 1. I would recommend a neuropath when using this but I'm very well trained and aware of my body,570,8,52;;

5-HTP ,For Insomnia,11-Aug-11,Anonymous,Not Specified,It works very well with my Ambien pills which have almost stopped working but can't sleep without (sounds familiar to chronic insomniacs I guess). I fall asleep amazingly fast (faster than at any time in my life) and I sleep up to 8 hours which I had forgotten about even on Ambien! I take only 50mg in late afternoon with food because I have a sensitive stomach.,363,5,70;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,15-Nov-17,Mrsv,Taken for 2 to 5 years,So good for short term use. I used for over a 2 year period cycling it out every 4 months for 4 weeks. Took it with magnesium at bedtime and found it very helpful for reducing attacks. Also had very restful sleeps with it.,222,9,38;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,10-Apr-17,NoNic...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I have been taking 5-HTP for about a month now for depression and mood swings. Works on depression and moods but over the last few days I have been experiencing severe stomach cramps. I have not changed my diet and still doing and taking everything as normal. The only difference is that I had added 5-HTP to my daily diet. After experiencing these stomach cramps I decided to research these effects it was having on me. Apparently stomach cramps are a well known side effect of 5-HTP so I have decided to stop taking them and try something different. ,552,2,39;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,13-Dec-20,Sandr...,Taken for less than 1 month,I have been taking 100mg 5-htp at night and it works really well for me (I have PTSD/anxiety). I've tried prescription SSRI like Prozac and that didn't work. This herb works for me way better. I'm calming through out the day and I feel way less nervous and I no longer have a dark cloud over me. I'm so happy I decided to give this a try. Some side effects I do get especially in the beginning is kind of weird dreams and sometimes seems to raise my anxiety by the 3rd hour but then goes away. I have barely any anxiety the morning I wake up and lasting all day till night time I take my medication. This seems to be a life saver for me. I will continue to use it and see how I do!,681,9,19;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,8-Feb-19,Dano,Not Specified,I found this treatment in Boots under the product name Sharp Mind it's combined with other natural ingredients. It started to work very quickly and my anxiety and depression has been much better but I have found that it is giving me strange dreams both good and bad sometimes very vivid. I still think that overall I have improved in my mood and I'll continue to take it for now. I'm only a week in but I quite like feeling happier and don't want to go back to my old feelings.,477,8,28;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,29-Aug-20,Jennnnn,Taken for less than 1 month,I've been struggling with anxiety and panic disorder for 3 years now and finally built the courage to try a supplement. This is my 3rd day on Natrol's Daily Stress Relief. It has 5-Htp magnesium B6 and 12 and some other vitamins. 100mg after breakfast. Everyday it's been different. My first day was amazing. I felt the physical symptoms I was anxious but I didn't fear the sensation. I that even makes sense. I was in tears because I haven't felt not not being scared in 3 years. My 2nd day was horrible... terrible anxiety symptoms constant palpitations panic attack and a meltdown. Today is my 3rd day I felt so off today...anxious irritable like nothing satisfied me (I'm usually a happy upbeat person despite the anxiety) I was thinking about not taking it anymore because it feels like I'm getting more negatives than positives but I read a few comments about taking a lower dose. So tomorrow I'm going to try splitting the pill in half and take 50mg. I hope it makes me feel better.,989,5,19;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,26-Feb-20,Brian,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I decided to give meds a break and though it was hard getting off them I felt somewhat ok for a while. I physically felt better yet I still had worse social anxiety. My nerves have felt somewhat on end for past two years. I don’t like meds or side effects I’ve tried a million remedies. I can say 5 htp is probably the best natural supplement I’ve tried in regards to my mental health though having had a few bad experiences. (Taking on empty stomach) (taking early) (taking right before bed which kept me awake). Though I’ve repeatedly decided to not take anything or tried other supplements taken with food in afternoon or at night every day or even every other day has been beneficial.,688,6,21;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,3-Nov-17,Miche...,Not Specified,I was very optimistic about this supplement. Unfortunately for me personally I had major sharp pains in my right side of my abdomen (possibly my liver). It even woke me up at night. I couldn't take it anymore as it seemed unsafe to continue. The brand I used was Now brand. Maybe it was the brand. However I would caution others to be careful if they also get sharp stabbing pains. Happy it helped others. Didn't agree with me.,427,1,31;;
5-HTP ,For ADHD,11-Aug-19,Kitty,Taken for 5 to 10 years,I am 54 and have ADHD (combination-type). Numerous tests show no anxiety no stress and no depression. I've been taking 5-HTP for about seven years. 160mg every morning thirty minutes before food is my current sweet spot to help with my irritability. It doesn't help me with any other ADHD symptoms eg. dysfunctional working memory or concentration. If I've had a 15-hour working day I may have a 100mg dose before retiring as I feel exhausted the next morning and know that I'll be irritable (stop the world I want to get off) with everyone who rubs me up the wrong way until my morning dose kicks in. Only side effect is nausea if I wait more than thirty minutes before eating. Just remember to keep your stock levels sufficient (set a reminder) so that you don't run out and then have the added drama of rushing around to buy some while you're in a bad mood. I buy them from a website in New Zealand and they arrive in Australia within a few days.,949,9,22;;
5-HTP ,Not Mentioned,22-Apr-15,North...,Taken for less than 1 month,This drug does increase serotonin levels and made me feel quite good so it gets an 8. It didn't work out for me because I was dumb and took it along with an Anti-D. (Do NOT do this). My appetite after starting 5-HTP was very high and I was salivating quite a bit which reminded me of starting Paxil or Prozac. But a few days in I got one (unusual) and reportedly rare side effect: Severe bruxism (teeth grinding). I believe I was getting a 'less severe' but still significant case of serotonin syndrome. I stopped the 5-HTP quickly. Do not take 5-HTP with Rhodiola Saint Johns Wort Buspirone or any anti-D Read up on Serotonin syndrome. That said this stuff works - but don't ever combine!,689,8,35;;
5-HTP ,For Headache,27-Mar-18,Devon,Taken for 2 to 5 years,5HTP has made all the difference to my life. I have suffered with debilitating menstrual migraines for years also PMT/depression. This wonderful natural drug takes the edge off it massively and enables me to function much more normally. I take 200mg at night about a week before my period when I feel my head/mood change. About a week after my period when I typically start to feel more normal I reduce to 100mg. Unfortunately I can't manage without it now but it has no side effects so I am extremely thankful for it - it has literally saved my life.,551,10,25;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,17-Apr-17,Portend,Not Specified,I felt great...very calm and confident. But combining 5-HTP with alcohol has caused adverse reactions. Additionally I feel a sudden down swing sometimes and take a second dose each dose being 50 mg. Since the supplement I take called Medulla also contains GABA I am not sure I am doing the right thing especially drinking up to 4 glasses of wine per night. Lately I have poured the wine out because I've felt odd. I am afraid that combining this with other supplements I take plus Avapro for hypertension might eventually do harm as the depression feels on the edge of returning and I feel agitated at times.,608,8,28;;
5-HTP ,For Insomnia,25-Apr-15,Anonymous,Taken for 2 to 5 years,I have a love hate relationship with 5 HTP. it has definitely helped me sleep in the past but after a while I build up a tolerance.

I start by taking little by little too so it won't hit so hard if I take the whole dose (like a quarter of a whole) just to see how I feel in a few,614,10,14;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,9-Jun-19,Zobo,Taken for less than 1 month,7 days ago I went cold turkey off Phenibut (dangerous beware severe withdrawals) no sleep extreme anxiety (I also have generalised and panic attack disorder) and extremely bad depression which I’ve never had. I came across 5HTP which has seemed to help with the depression and anxiety but it’s only been 3 days.

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,30-Aug-21,Anonymous,Taken for less than 1 month,I’ve been dealing with some intense anxiety and sadness. Pretty sure all my symptoms point to anxiety. I started a supplement with 5Htp in it. Took it for 2 days and had a massive dizzy spell so I stopped taking it thinking it was the supplement. Started a week later and it’s been four days and I honestly feel my symptoms are much worse than before. It’s 50mg of 5Htp I’ve researched the other ingredients in the supplement and no other ones seem to make my symptoms worse. I will take a break and see what happens.,517,1,10;;
5-HTP ,For Anxiety,11-Feb-22,regina,Taken for less than 1 month,BE CAREFUL! I took 5-htp without any advice from the doctor and it kick started my panic attacks journey. Of course I had some trauma deeply rooted in my subconscious that was the primary reason of my panic attacks but 5-htp unleashed all of it! I ended up having to go to a psychiatrist and went on SSRIs to fix myself. The doctor told me the dosage advised on the 5-htp box (100-200mg/day) was way to high for me and that messed up my brain. Just don’t take this without a doctor’s advice please it might do more harm!,520,3,8;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,24-Apr-18,Anna,Not Specified,I was recommended this by a close family friend who also suffers from anxiety. I took 50mg a couple of times a week a few months ago and didn't notice a change or any negative side effects at that time. I have been feeling more anxious over the past few weeks due to hormonal imbalance/other issues so I decided to try again one night when the anxiety was really bad just to see if it could alleviate some of it. I took 1 50mg capsule about an hour after dinner and for the first few hours after I took it I actually felt noticeably less anxious. At one point my entire body felt very peaceful and relaxed and almost had a warm feeling to it. It did not help me sleep though like some people commented I woke up multiple times throughout the night and tossed and turned and then around 6AM woke up feeling nauseous wide awake and anxious again. I'm not sure if this is because of my hormonal imbalance issues right now or side effects from this but not sure its worth it to try again.,984,5,18;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,19-Jan-23,Healt...,Taken for 5 to 10 years,I have taken this supplement for over 7 years. I’m not sure if it still works as good as it used to and came here to see about raising dosages. My experience has been overall good. I am a diagnosed NPD. I have increased anxiety around anyone who does better than me in life. To put it mildly I loathe anyone who might have some sort of leg up on me. My son-in-law is one of these people. Very confident person and can’t seem to be manipulated by anyone. I’m not kidding when I say I just absolutely can’t deal with myself when I am around him or any strong male really. My speech is off I have stomach knots inside is like a raging fire in my head. I’m working closely with a therapist to change my way of thinking and understand it’s actually me that is the problem and that I am just an insecure old man with a lack of empathy. I have noticed on days when I take a double dose of 200 mg before seeing my son in law I am much more lively and actually enjoy my Son in law.,972,7,2;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,4-Aug-21,John,Taken for 1 to 6 months,When you first take 5htp you should start out slow 50 mg a day a few hours before sleep. Make sure you use a reputable brand and make sure it is enteric coated and have with vitamin b6 and C so it can convert to serotonin. The enteric coating will help prevent the 5htp from converting to serotonin in the stomach which can cause stomach upset. Up the dosage slowly until you start noticing a benefit. (Effective dosages are between 50 to 300 mgs a day.) As with any supplement or medication give it time. Give the product at least 6 - 8 weeks to notice a benefit.,564,7,4;;

5-HTP ,For Insomnia,29-Oct-21,Anonymous,Taken for less than 1 month,Was recommended to take 5 HTP because I have no problem falling asleep but rather staying asleep. Took 100 mg and slept better (still work up but it a much calmer way) but then next day after taking 100mg again I could tell it prevented me falling asleep and also elevated my heart rate to the point that I couldn’t sleep at all. Am going to speak to a doctor to ask whether it might work at a significantly lower dose. So many websites say 100 mg is fine and even say 200mg is ok to start with—I wish more recommended 25 max to begin especially if you’re sensitive.,566,5,3;;

5-HTP ,For Anxiety,8-Jun-22,Girl,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Started 5HTP for very debilitating anxiety almost 10 months ago. I started at 100mg and went up to 300mg within a couple of weeks. However within a week I felt a difference. The anxiety was slightly reduced but the main effect was I was more motivated enthusiastic and had a spring in my steps. So much happier (and slightly more resilient to anxiety) ! I thought that this drug would be a miracle for people with depression rather than anxiety. Unfortunately this wonderful effect disappeared a couple of months later. My conclusion is that it may not be suited for long term anxiety or depression but if you are going through a rough patch it may give you the leg up you need during those few weeks. I will now switch to something else. Only side effect was minor headaches for a couple of days when I started or upped the dose.,830,5,0;;

I was skeptical but decided that it was worth the 20 bucks to see if it would help alleviate my anxiety issues. I was teaching a class that night and took one of the 5 HTP pills (50 mg) and kind of forgot about it. Several hours had passed and I was on my way home from said class and realized I felt pretty good and relaxed and then remembered the pill I had taken. I was still skeptical however and decided to try another one the next day and I got the same feeling. It's not a tired or groggy feeling it's actual relief from anxiety and it really works.

I've used 50mg once daily for the past few years to help with depression/anxiety/sleep issues and it did help for a while especially with sleeping better. Unfortunately I now have to stop after realizing it has been making symptoms worse after taking it probably too long. Too much serotonin in your system will cause worse anxiety so just know that just because this product is sold in the health food section - I would definitely consider it a natural drug you should do your research on. If the dose is too high it will cause worse anxiety issues. This drug can also interact with other medications and alcohol so just be aware. Buy a brand with good reviews and figure out what time of day taking it works best for you. It made me a bit too relaxed to take it in the morning but taking it right before bed caused crazy dreams,896,7,83;;

I actually went to the ER the first night it happened because I thought I was dying. Doctor originally thought the issue was caused by stomach acid getting into lungs but antacids did nothing. Doctor then suggested 5 HTP a week later. No more attacks (other than the one night I forgot to take the pill) after I started taking 100mg before bed. If you plan on taking 5HTP get quality product (don’t go cheap trying to save a dollar). Some of the lower quality stuff can have its own side effects. Good luck.,718,10,77;;

For the first 7-10 days I did have quite noticeable side effects headaches feeling nauseous and shaking a little but I continued to take it as TBH it was better than side effects of prescribed anti depressants I've experienced in the past  which is probably not the most sensible but now I'm happy I did. I take this with a combination of L-tyrosine and B vitamins and magnesium. Probably also worth mentioning is the ease I've managed to sort out my binge eating I've lost 13kg in the last 4 months which has been a fantastic thing for me and now my BMI is back in the healthy range.,809,9,81;;

I was on citalopram but became too much of a problem for me having to go to the doctors every month and having work. Getting this delivered to my door was so much easier. Been taking 100mg every night before bed its reduced my anxiety quite a bit. I'm still on a benzo for the time being but what people here have to understand this drug works with chemicals in you brain. This is the reason you get increased anxiety. When I started citalopram my anxiety went through the roof before improving my condition after about 8 weeks. Let it ride through and take it at night at first it will increase your anxiety,646,10,90;;

5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,26-Feb-16,Dizzie-,Taken for less than 1 month,Don't take this with benzos made me extra drowsy and anxious. One pill I only took half of one pill (50mg!). I got some kind of adverse reaction. My insomnia got worse I got panic attacks shivering tremor felt disorientated and seriously more depressed. Now I have woken up in the middle of the night for many nights to same feeling: anxious cant fall asleep again. I regret taking this. And I said once again: DONT MIX THIS WITH BENZOS and be careful if your nervous system is sensitive you are sensitive to supplements or you suffer from bad insomnia cause it can cause paradoxical reaction. Start with tiny doses to find out whether this is the right supplement to you. For me it definately is NOT. This supplement also has many side effects,744,1,84;;

I have a couple different blends with the 5HTP B6 L Theanine and one for night with melatonin they are both 50 mg and I usually only take 1/2. It tends to make me calm and tired so I prefer night dose but that night dose seems to keep me calm and in a much better mood all of the next day. I have had no side effects other than needing a nap after taking 100mg. It starts working quickly like 1/2 hour. I do find that after 2-3 weeks it tends to quit working so I take a week off then start again.,556,9,43;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,1-Mar-17,Aldoyle,Taken for less than 1 month,This stuff works great! For people that get sick or anything I'm just going to tell you most likely you got serotonin syndrome from it because of too much of the chemical in your system and that is dangerous so be careful. I do note that it makes me sleep super well but the grogginess tends to linger around and I need a couple cups of coffee to cut through it. That being said I have that niarvana feeling of calmness and clarity. My mood and motivation is improved massively as well. I had especially hard times with waking up and getting started in anything that includes things I love doing and finishing things after taking this it right away really sparked up my missing link.

So I've started to take 100 mg of 5-htp at night with a bit (7.5 mg) of mirtazipine and bang  gone for the WHOLE night. Incredible. I was so happy after searching for a remedy for years. I've started to take some small doses of 5 htp during day time ( 50mg at noon) and my anxiety is down. Now I have to let go the ATIVAN slowly but surely for my daily anxiety because it is now useless so I just have to figure out the right dosage and hope to use only this and nothing else for my sleeping problem and anxiety.

With menopause just around the corner there are days my anxiety is off the charts. About 6 months ago I started taking 100mg daily. I was also having moderate to severe panic heart palpitations sweating and severe vomiting. I didn’t make the connection to 5HTP until I recently started taking it again. This time only 25mg. Same symptoms but milder. I cannot be 100% sure but I’m making the connection to this supplement. If you’re thinking of taking thus supplement I highly recommend talking to a holistic health practitioner first. Not to be dramatic but my episodes landed me in the ED three times last year.

It started in my early forties when perimenopause hit. Tried 5-HTP recently and after 2 weeks I'm sleeping great! I take 200 mg time-release an hour before bed. Also drink milk/buttermilk before bed. And gelatin mixed with hot water and juice earlier. I only take Ambien or Ativan when I still can't get to sleep but that's unusual. Since I'm sleeping sounding again like when I was younger my energy level is back to normal and I feel great again! I also changed my diet to low sugar/ high fiber. 5-HTP is a life saver to me!!!,584,10,52;;

Foggy feelings during the day with occasional odd sense of impending doom. Anxiety that keeps me indoors...But when I decide to go out despite odd feelings I find myself to be strangely aggressive. It's a seems that I'm less tolerant to other people. For example there is a cashier who is always rude a real eye roller with frequent head shaking and sighs. Well after she rolled her eyes at me for asking for a pen she reluctantly smacked down on the counter. I tossed it at her after using it. Hmmm this is odd behavior for me I usually don't react to other people like that..So I've decided to quit this 5- Htp for now. I could end up doing something that gets me on the news,739,4,49;;

5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,2-Feb-19,perle...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,Combined with therapy I can almost say for sure that 5-HTP helps me. After a really painful breakup I was having looping suicidal thoughts (the thought of a gun going bang all the time) and was in a really sordid mood overall. A week or so into taking 100mg 3x daily I felt I was going better although I didn't necessarily think 5-HTP had played a role (I'm kind of skeptical person). I thought my improving mood was 100% due to a therapy with someone who really cares. I finished my 1-month supply bottle and stopped taking. Within a day or two my mood mysteriously took a hard hit. Just today I bought a new bottle. I'm pretty sure it'll help me again. I can't compare to big pharma meds because I never took them. I take this combined with Omega-3. I like the fact that there are 0 side effects for me. I'll continue taking 5-HTP at least for a while. 5-HTP isn't especially cheap but it's worth a try if your symptoms are really messing with your life.,956,8,36;;

The only difference is that I had added 5-HTP to my daily diet. After experiencing these stomach cramps I decided to research these effects it was having on me.

5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,13-Dec-20,Sandr...,Taken for less than 1 month,I have been taking 100mg 5-htp at night and it works really well for me (I have PTSD/anxiety). I've tried prescription SSRI like Prozac and that didn't work. This herb works for me way better. I'm calming through out the day and I feel way less nervous and I no longer have a dark cloud over me. I'm so happy I decided to give this a try. Some side effects I do get especially in the beginning is kind of weird dreams and sometimes seems to raise my anxiety by the 3rd hour but then goes away. I have barely any anxiety the morning I wake up and lasting all day till night time I take my medication. This seems to be a life saver for me. I will continue to use it and see how I do!,681,9,19;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,8-Feb-19,Dano,Not Specified,I found this treatment in Boots under the product name Sharp Mind it's combined with other natural ingredients. It started to work very quickly and my anxiety and depression has been much better but I have found that it is giving me strange dreams both good and bad sometimes very vivid. I still think that overall I have improved in my mood and I'll continue to take it for now. I'm only a week in but I quite like feeling happier and don't want to go back to my old feelings.,477,8,28;;

5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,29-Aug-20,Jennnnn,Taken for less than 1 month,I've been struggling with anxiety and panic disorder for 3 years now and finally built the courage to try a supplement. This is my 3rd day on Natrol's Daily Stress Relief. It has 5-Htp magnesium B6 and 12 and some other vitamins. 100mg after breakfast. Everyday it's been different. My first day was amazing. I felt the physical symptoms I was anxious but I didn't fear the sensation. I that even makes sense. I was in tears because I haven't felt not not being scared in 3 years. My 2nd day was horrible... terrible anxiety symptoms constant palpitations panic attack and a meltdown. Today is my 3rd day I felt so off today...anxious irritable like nothing satisfied me (I'm usually a happy upbeat person despite the anxiety) I was thinking about not taking it anymore because it feels like I'm getting more negatives than positives but I read a few comments about taking a lower dose. So tomorrow I'm going to try splitting the pill in half and take 50mg. I hope it makes me feel better.,989,5,19;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,26-Feb-20,Brian,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I decided to give meds a break and though it was hard getting off them I felt somewhat ok for a while. I physically felt better yet I still had worse social anxiety. My nerves have felt somewhat on end for past two years. I don’t like meds or side effects I’ve tried a million remedies. I can say 5 htp is probably the best natural supplement I’ve tried in regards to my mental health though having had a few bad experiences. (Taking on empty stomach) (taking early) (taking right before bed which kept me awake). Though I’ve repeatedly decided to not take anything or tried other supplements taken with food in afternoon or at night every day or even every other day has been beneficial.,688,6,21;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,3-Nov-17,Miche...,Not Specified,I was very optimistic about this supplement. Unfortunately for me personally I had major sharp pains in my right side of my abdomen (possibly my liver). It even woke me up at night. I couldn't take it anymore as it seemed unsafe to continue. The brand I used was Now brand. Maybe it was the brand. However I would caution others to be careful if they also get sharp stabbing pains. Happy it helped others. Didn't agree with me.,427,1,31;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for ADHD,11-Aug-19,Kitty,Taken for 5 to 10 years,I am 54 and have ADHD (combination-type). Numerous tests show no anxiety no stress and no depression. I've been taking 5-HTP for about seven years. 160mg every morning thirty minutes before food is my current sweet spot to help with my irritability. It doesn't help me with any other ADHD symptoms eg. dysfunctional working memory or concentration. If I've had a 15-hour working day I may have a 100mg dose before retiring as I feel exhausted the next morning and know that I'll be irritable (stop the world I want to get off) with everyone who rubs me up the wrong way until my morning dose kicks in. Only side effect is nausea if I wait more than thirty minutes before eating. Just remember to keep your stock levels sufficient (set a reminder) so that you don't run out and then have the added drama of rushing around to buy some while you're in a bad mood. I buy them from a website in New Zealand and they arrive in Australia within a few days.,949,9,22;;

5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan),22-Apr-15,North...,Taken for less than 1 month,This drug does increase serotonin levels and made me feel quite good so it gets an 8. It didn't work out for me because I was dumb and took it along with an Anti-D. (Do NOT do this). My appetite after starting 5-HTP was very high and I was salivating quite a bit which reminded me of starting Paxil or Prozac. But a few days in I got one (unusual) and reportedly rare side effect: Severe bruxism (teeth grinding). I believe I was getting a 'less severe' but still significant case of serotonin syndrome. I stopped the 5-HTP quickly. Do not take 5-HTP with Rhodiola Saint Johns Wort Buspirone or any anti-D Read up on Serotonin syndrome. That said this stuff works - but don't ever combine!,689,8,35;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Headache,27-Mar-18,Devon,Taken for 2 to 5 years,5HTP has made all the difference to my life. I have suffered with debilitating menstrual migraines for years also PMT/depression. This wonderful natural drug takes the edge off it massively and enables me to function much more normally. I take 200mg at night about a week before my period when I feel my head/mood change. About a week after my period when I typically start to feel more normal I reduce to 100mg. Unfortunately I can't manage without it now but it has no side effects so I am extremely thankful for it - it has literally saved my life.,551,10,25;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,17-Apr-17,Portend,Not Specified,I felt great...very calm and confident. But combining 5-HTP with alcohol has caused adverse reactions. Additionally I feel a sudden down swing sometimes and take a second dose each dose being 50 mg. Since the supplement I take called Medulla also contains GABA I am not sure I am doing the right thing especially drinking up to 4 glasses of wine per night. Lately I have poured the wine out because I've felt odd. I am afraid that combining this with other supplements I take plus Avapro for hypertension might eventually do harm as the depression feels on the edge of returning and I feel agitated at times.,608,8,28;;

I took antidepressant in the past and it really helped but this time I decided to try natural remedy. I went from 100 mg a day to 300mg. At first the results were great-just like when I took antidepressant. My depression lifted sleep improved I was not as anxious. Unfortunately after a few weeks 5-HTP just stopped working. The positive effects were very short-lived.,469,3,28;;

I start by taking little by little too so it won't hit so hard if I take the whole dose (like a quarter of a whole) just to see how I feel in a few,614,10,14;;

I came across 5HTP which has seemed to help with the depression and anxiety but it’s only been 3 days.

5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,30-Aug-21,Anonymous,Taken for less than 1 month,I’ve been dealing with some intense anxiety and sadness. Pretty sure all my symptoms point to anxiety. I started a supplement with 5Htp in it. Took it for 2 days and had a massive dizzy spell so I stopped taking it thinking it was the supplement. Started a week later and it’s been four days and I honestly feel my symptoms are much worse than before. It’s 50mg of 5Htp I’ve researched the other ingredients in the supplement and no other ones seem to make my symptoms worse. I will take a break and see what happens.,517,1,10;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,11-Feb-22,regina,Taken for less than 1 month,BE CAREFUL! I took 5-htp without any advice from the doctor and it kick started my panic attacks journey. Of course I had some trauma deeply rooted in my subconscious that was the primary reason of my panic attacks but 5-htp unleashed all of it! I ended up having to go to a psychiatrist and went on SSRIs to fix myself. The doctor told me the dosage advised on the 5-htp box (100-200mg/day) was way to high for me and that messed up my brain. Just don’t take this without a doctor’s advice please it might do more harm!,520,3,8;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan),31-Jul-20,Kieran,Taken for less than 1 month,I have mild depression with low serotonin found. I have tried four antidepressants for a decade and always had terrible side effects. I have started to take 5-HTP 75mg once a days and it works great! Not sure for the long term for now but I don't feel like garbage don't have suicidal thoughts and don't feel irritable. When I stop all those symptoms come back.,361,10,12;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,For Anxiety,16-Oct-19,Jay,Taken for less than 1 month,Tried this after trying to get off SSRI's. Had anxiety building up to pre-panic attack on my second day on this. After taking 100mg started to feel the anxiety melt away and pretty much relaxed after an hour. After day 3 have noticed my acid reflux going away too. After researching found out serotonin stops gastic acid production. Usually take around night time with a multivitamin It tends to make me sleepy in a couple hours. Pretty much as effective as SSR's for without as many side effects. Just get a lil disoriented once in a while but a very small price to pay compared to having anxiety.,598,10,14;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,24-Apr-18,Anna,Not Specified,I was recommended this by a close family friend who also suffers from anxiety. I took 50mg a couple of times a week a few months ago and didn't notice a change or any negative side effects at that time. I have been feeling more anxious over the past few weeks due to hormonal imbalance/other issues so I decided to try again one night when the anxiety was really bad just to see if it could alleviate some of it. I took 1 50mg capsule about an hour after dinner and for the first few hours after I took it I actually felt noticeably less anxious. At one point my entire body felt very peaceful and relaxed and almost had a warm feeling to it. It did not help me sleep though like some people commented I woke up multiple times throughout the night and tossed and turned and then around 6AM woke up feeling nauseous wide awake and anxious again. I'm not sure if this is because of my hormonal imbalance issues right now or side effects from this but not sure its worth it to try again.,984,5,18;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,For Anxiety,11-Sep-19,Maya,Not Specified,I started taking 5 htp three weeks ago. This third week was when I noticed it started working a bit. For some people it can take as little as two weeks but I wasn’t keeping up with taking it in the second week. Today I woke up feeling kind of happier and it felt really just amazing. I have been depressed for about a year or more so I was just shocked at feeling this happiness. A couple months ago I was struggling even more and was prescribed Zoloft. I was told to take half of a Zoloft pill each night to build up to one complete pill. Well the first night I took it I woke up sweating a lot and felt kind of scared. I stopped taking Zoloft and looked for natural pills and that’s how I found 5 HTP.,703,8,14;;

I have severe insomnia due to a problem with fibromyalgia. That being said. Go for it. The Klonopin alone didn't do it but the combo cocktail does. I feel like the quality of sleep is better also.

I am sleeping a lot better although not through the night. However now when I awake I read about 30-45 minutes and then go back to sleep for the remainder of the night.

I’m not sure if it still works as good as it used to and came here to see about raising dosages. My experience has been overall good. I am a diagnosed NPD. I have increased anxiety around anyone who does better than me in life. To put it mildly I loathe anyone who might have some sort of leg up on me. My son-in-law is one of these people. Very confident person and can’t seem to be manipulated by anyone. I’m not kidding when I say I just absolutely can’t deal with myself when I am around him or any strong male really. My speech is off I have stomach knots inside is like a raging fire in my head. I’m working closely with a therapist to change my way of thinking and understand it’s actually me that is the problem and that I am just an insecure old man with a lack of empathy.

I did some research on natural supplements and found 5htp and haven’t looked back. I’ve been on between 100-200 mg a day for probably almost two years and I couldn’t be happier.

5-hydroxytryptophan ,For Anxiety,13-Jan-19,Anonymous,Not Specified,This has been a game changer drug for me. I take 100mg in the morning and 100mg at night the brand is Irwin and it has some other helpful herbs mixed in b6 cbd etc. I was on paxil four years ago then had a break and had started to feel like I needed to get back on something for my anxiety and depression. It was affecting my life and relationship. Extremely hard to control my racing thoughts I decided to give 5HTP a shot. I highly recommend it. It has allowed the stress in my life to be seen for what they are. I still get emotions cry laugh but nothing is as manic and extreme as was. I am so grateful for this product as it is allowing me to live my life but not numb out my feeling or experiences. I am a little concerned about the dependence side of things but since I have not seen any negative side effects yet (upset stomach and diarrhea the first three days) I do not mind being on this product for as long as I need too.,933,10,8;;

5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,4-Aug-21,John,Taken for 1 to 6 months,When you first take 5htp you should start out slow 50 mg a day a few hours before sleep. Make sure you use a reputable brand and make sure it is enteric coated and have with vitamin b6 and C so it can convert to serotonin. The enteric coating will help prevent the 5htp from converting to serotonin in the stomach which can cause stomach upset. Up the dosage slowly until you start noticing a benefit. (Effective dosages are between 50 to 300 mgs a day.) As with any supplement or medication give it time. Give the product at least 6 - 8 weeks to notice a benefit.,564,7,4;;

Am going to speak to a doctor to ask whether it might work at a significantly lower dose. So many websites say 100 mg is fine and even say 200mg is ok to start with—I wish more recommended 25 max to begin especially if you’re sensitive.,566,5,3;;

This is my 1st time taking meds and I don't know what to do. Ugh I am not happy. $22 down the drain.,609,3,6;;

5-hydroxytryptophan ,For Depression,8-Apr-21,Robert,Taken for less than 1 month,I've suffered from chronic fatigue for 3 years now. Okay during the day but as soon as I'm off work I'm exhausted and have no energy or motivation. With a 3 year old I need to be able to do more. I've tried many things and a few worked for a short time then stopped. Also have sleep issues which may contribute. I've been taking this for 2 weeks and it's incredible. I at 50 I feel 20 years younger. Come home with lots of energy and my mood is awesome. If you asked me if I was depressed a few weeks ago I'd have sad no. But in comparison to how I feel now I'd say I must have been. I also fall asleep much faster and sleep more soundly. Although I do wake a few times but easily fall back to sleep. My wife say I no longer toss and turn or talk on my sleep. I've literally never felt better. Improved focus and clarity at work and increased energy. Based on this experience I'd say and hope my problem was low levels of Tryptophan. I only hope it's a long term fix and not a flash in the pan.,994,10,2;;
5-hydroxytryptophan ,For Anxiety,15-Sep-17,Kody...,Taken for less than 1 month,After being on Zoloft I thought it was hopeless until I tried 5-HTP. I've only been on the drug for 2 days but already feel a tremendous sense of well being which I never felt on an anti depressant. I guess if you need an anti depressant for something more severe go for it. Although I could see this drug used only for mild depression and anxiety some part of me believes it could be used as a long term medicine for some. I have nothing but positive results so far!,467,10,4;;

5-hydroxytryptophan ,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) for Anxiety,8-Jun-22,Girl,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Started 5HTP for very debilitating anxiety almost 10 months ago. I started at 100mg and went up to 300mg within a couple of weeks. However within a week I felt a difference. The anxiety was slightly reduced but the main effect was I was more motivated enthusiastic and had a spring in my steps. So much happier (and slightly more resilient to anxiety) ! I thought that this drug would be a miracle for people with depression rather than anxiety. Unfortunately this wonderful effect disappeared a couple of months later. My conclusion is that it may not be suited for long term anxiety or depression but if you are going through a rough patch it may give you the leg up you need during those few weeks. I will now switch to something else. Only side effect was minor headaches for a couple of days when I started or upped the dose.,830,5,0;;

I was weighing 69 kilograms for many years much before my HIV infection. My initial viral load was very low my CD4 count was 521 so it was okay. I started gaining a lot of weight with Triumeq I can’t blame it all on this ART but of course it has a big role since it causes lipodystrophy. I realized I accumulated more fat around my belly and it was harder than usual I’m also experiencing a lot of heartburn and gastritis especially if I take it with food (but it is better taking it with food because it’s absorbed a little better but there’s no problem to take it without food ). So the weight gain and the hard belly are a big downside for me. I’ll discuss with my doctor other options and analyze the pros and cons.,797,1,0;;

Abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine for HIV Infection ,Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine),11-Nov-15,Be Ca...,Taken for less than 1 month,I am a long term survivor with no HIV related complications ever. I have never had an adverse reaction to an HIV medication as well. I took the blood test to make sure I was not allergic to the medication. I did my homework on this drug as well and many people really like it. I was basically bedridden for 19 days and got off the medication. 2 days later I ended up in the ER with pancreas complications. Making your life easier with 1 pill a day is not necessarily the way to go. In my opinion they marketed this drug too quickly.,532,1,27;;

My last meds stopped working even though I had 100% adherence. Since taking Triumeq I've not slept properly (taking me ages to fall asleep and then waking during the night and taking a long time to go back to sleep) and I'm someone who normally sleeps like a kitten. The other thing I've noticed is really itchy skin: face neck torso legs....no rash just constant itchy feeling. I've had a couple of dizzy spells one of which made me panic and my heart rate went up to 134 (I was just washing the dishes!). I'll stick with them as one week is too short a time to decide if I can live with the side effects or if they are just temporary. I'll post again in a few weeks.,723,5,15;;

The last 2 causes so much nausea and vomiting that I couldn't take it. Also it was messing up my liver. My doctor put me on this and I've had little to no side effects. I have nausea but that's only if I take it on a empty stomach and it only last for about 20 minutes. I'm undetectable now and my CD4 count came from 14 to 376 the last time I checked last year. I'm going back in September to check my progress. This drug saved my life. I was basically on my deathbed before this drug.,536,9,21;;

I started on the medicine after months of being sick and immunity loss. My viral load was rising and my cd4 was falling fast due to lifestyle choices. Getting on this medicine was a hard decision but one I would make again and this time I'd do it sooner. Within no time I was undetectable and my immunity doubled. My Dr told me it wouldn't work as quick as it did so we were both pleasantly surprised on my numbers. It has now been a year still undetectable and now 9 months pregt with a healthy baby boy. I would recommend this drug to anyone with HIV who is offered it by their doctor. My side effects include upset stomach.,738,9,23;;

My initial concerns and scares about side effects quickly turned out to be untrue. Apart from tiredness and join pain in the first few weeks I have virtually no side effects from the medication. I take it in the evening and aim to have 100% adherence. It is remarkable what science has done in the last 30 years since this condition emerged. One of the drugs in the pill dolutegravir has a long binding time and so far has had no resistance.I look forward to the results of trials with dolutegravir monotherapy. This would be even better in using only one drug to control the virus. I'd recommend Triumeq to anyone starting treatment or those considering a switch.,741,10,23;;
Abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine for HIV Infection ,Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine),16-Jun-19,Peter,16-Jun-19,I took Triumeq from early 2016 to early 2017. Although it kept my viral load undetectable I suffered serious side effects: Bizarre dreams burping and acid reflux and serious heart diseases. It caused irregular heart beats and my heart rates went up to 200 beats per minute when I did light exercises (elliptical) which caused blood pressure to drop so low I collapsed. I also experienced blackout for a brief second several times a day during walking sitting and out of nowhere. I also developed a stenosis on my artery it's fat buildup in my main blood vessel on my neck that caused my blood flow to drop to 40-50% of normal. And if the fat gets detached and goes into my brain I will have a stroke. Cardiologist said I should not have heart problem because there is no history of heart disease in my family and I am not overweight and this problem only started after taking Triumeq. So doctor changed medication to Descovy + Tivicay and all the aforementioned side effects went away.,985,2,15;;

Any increase in dose resulted in marked tachycardia (fast heart beat) that was uncomfortable. I also experienced considerable fatigue. None of the osteoporosis drugs are without significant side effects. No good options very unfortunately for those of us who suffer from this. Also it takes awhile to get used to doing subQ injections the very weird way the company recommends...injecting directly at a 90 degree angle right into your abdominal skin.

From the first injection I experienced a rapid heart rate dull aching in my mid-back kidney area frequent urination and some dizziness. I used it before bed due to the side effects. If I got up at night I was often disoriented. The injections also sometimes caused bruising and pain. After 2 months I began using it every other day due to the side effects even though these were primarily at night. But I was really tired due to getting up at night to use the bathroom. I was optimistic about this drug as it is designed to grow bone rather than just stop bone loss like biophosphates and I was willing to continue treatment for another year. Super disappointed with my DEXA bone scan results and stopped Tymlos due to essentially zero benefits: Hip: -2.9. Prior -2.8 slight decrease; Femoral neck: -3.4. Prior -2.9 major decrease; Lumbar spine: -2.2. Prior -2.2 no change. For me Tymlos was not effective. Blessings on the journey toward stronger bones.,985,1,2

After all years of living with the pain of a condition and knowing our own bodies are not equivalent to that two-week course the health provider took. I experience burning and itching at the injection site that seems to grow bigger with each injection. It was the first time the needle actually hurt... a lot.,983,4,14;

After being off of it again for two days have felt lightheaded and my pulse slowed to what was not normal for me a drop of 10 to 15 beats per minute. I have come to the conclusion that the risks and side effects are not worth it.,493,1,14;;

I was on Humira for 10 years which helped greatly but the side effects began showing so I was forced to stop. I was off all RA meds for a couple of years and my condition began deteriorating again. I went on Orencia IV drip. I began showing almost all of the side effects listed about a month after my first dose. It was slowly poisoning me. I was sick all the time and showing severe symptoms; Exhaustion night sweats back pain migraines for 8 days straight diarrhea nausea and a level of discomfort I've never felt. It's an awful medicine with crippling side effects. It is important to note that the side effects were worse than the RA itself and my condition is moderate to severe. My suggestion is to avoid this medication at all cost. I was put on a anti nausea pill that is used for chemo patients.

It continues to work effectively at controlling my disease and 2023 marks my 18th year using Orencia. I had an increase in skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma) at first but I also have fair skin freckles and red hair. I continue to see a dermatologist regularly but my rate of skin cancer has leveled out and I might have 1 spot removed every year or two.

Abatacept ,Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,25-May-23,176,Taken for 1 to 6 months,Ended up being a nightmare drug. First RA drug I’ve tried that had such detrimental psychological side effects that I hope go away eventually after stopping. I had my anxiety and depression under control for 10 years was at peace in my mind and days felt bright minus the fatigue that comes with RA. Only drug I’m on currently. Since starting it months ago I’m in constant terror and a major depressive episode that’s wrecked havoc on my life. Also caused debilitating lower back and shoulder/neck pain. I had rapid weight gain even as someone who normally has difficulty gaining weight. It did work for joint pain and skin related stuff due to my condition usually the effects would be the most for the first couple days after injection though - not worth it. I hope this can be reversed once out of system which takes weeks….,827,2,3;;
Abatacept ,Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,20-Jun-17,Keato...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I've been doing the infusion for three months now. It hasn't improved any of my symptoms at all.

Abatacept ,Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,13-Jul-10,armor...,13-Jul-10,I am on my 5th month of treatment and have seen some improvement in overall pain/discomfort but still continue to have issues. I also have extreme fatigue the day after treatment. My doctor just increased my dose to the maximum to see if that works. I must take medication to sleep comfortably and medication to stay awake during the day. These medications interact. I supposedly have a mild case of rheumatoid arthritis and am still waiting to feel normal.,457,5,65;;
Abatacept ,Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10-Oct-18,Helen,Taken for 2 to 5 years,I took this medication for 2 years! 2 years my Rheumatologist forced me to stay on this nothing medication with obvious continuous flare and damage. I think 1 good year of giving a medication a go is sufficient but this useless Rheumatologist refused to try something else. In the meantime....my hands have obvious irreversible damage swollen hurt and I require pain pills to survive. This medication is useless.,412,1,30;;
Abatacept ,Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,12-Dec-14,emily,Taken for 1 to 2 years,Severe back pain and also in neck shoulders and arms started after being on Abatacept for about 3 months. More muscular pain than bone pain. Looking to come off it as its becoming problematic. I've been on 4 other biologic medicines and this was the most effective in getting flare ups under control.,300,5,46;;
Abatacept ,Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,7-Jan-21,Jay,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I was on Enbrel for over 15 years for RA. Shortly after I started on it I told my rheumatologist it was a miracle drug. I still had flares but the severe pain I had felt every day was pretty much gone. Then after so many years the pain started returning. My current rheumatologist switched me to Humira. After a month it seemed to be helping. But I was having nausea and a continuous headache with occasional dizziness. It was so bad I asked my rheumatologist to switch me to something else. She then put me on Orencia. I've been on it for 6 weeks but the pain I had before going on Humira has returned. And I also have nasal congestion 24/7. I'll give the Orencia a few more weeks until my next appointment with my rheumatologist and if the pain and congestion isn't any better I'll see what she wants to do. As a side note I've also been taking methotrexate for 15 years.,873,4,16;;
Abatacept ,Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8-Jul-21,Polly...,8-Jul-21,Severe RA became a part of my life 37 years ago before the biologics were developed. 3 weeks after Enbrel came on the market I started taking it in combo with hydroxychloroquine sulfazalazine methotrexate and NSAID. This combo worked for me for 17 years. It was a miracle. Then Enbrel effectiveness waned. I switched to Humira for about 8 months. Not effective. MD said I had probably developed auto antibodies to TNF alpha meds. I took xeljanz which did not help either. Then started injectable Orenica. After 3 months I was in a massive flare-up. I switched MDs and started Prednisone and IV Orencia 750/mo. Continued with hydroxychloroquine MTX sulfazalazine and NSAIDs. Flare up resolved in 6 months. Had to stop MTX last year due to severe crashing tinnitus. Continued the combo for 2 years. Now the IV Orencia is not available to me on Maui so I am back on injectable Orencia 125 mg/wk.,892,9,9;;
Abatacept ,Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10-May-21,Ruano,10-May-21,My Vectra score came back at 55 (high disease activity) and it was time to figure out a new course of meds. Methotrexate injections didn't help with the pain and thinned my hair. Next up biologics. Enbrel was a no go due to the possibility of heart failure and I was already experiencing high cardiac output. My first Orencia infusion was 2/11/2021. I experienced really bad HA's lower bp and extreme fatigue. The HA's and lower bp subsided a little. My rheumy and the IV nurse said to stay with it because it does take time. After the fourth infusion I began experiencing head & facial tingling causing my eye to freeze for a few seconds then stop. Tingling also in my left arm dizziness sore throat and stuffy nose. My rheumy she told me to stop the medication and offered Xeljanz. *long sigh* I really don't want to go on this medication tour and was really hoping Orencia would have worked. I heard so many good things from people who benefitted from it. Let's see what's next.,981,4,9;;

Abatacept ,Orencia (abatacept) for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,23-May-14,Anonymous,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,My daughter started monthly Orencia infusions for her Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis about 3 years after being diagnosed. She had been previously taking Enbrel and Methotrexate injections weekly for 3 years. Her arthritis became more aggressive so her Rheumatologist started her on Orencia. (Continuing the Methotrexate injections). She got used to the infusion part rather quickly. She had no side effects at all and the only problem we had was the occasional blown vein. Unfortunately the medication did not prove to be effective for her. After 8 months of constant flare ups oral steroids and steroid injections we decided to change the medications again. There are however 2 other children we know that the Orencia is helping prevent flare ups.,747,7,19;;

Abatacept ,Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9-Jan-23,Stacy,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I was encouraged to take Orencia by my rheumatologist after I had been experiencing vertigo and a racing heart from Humira. I was thrilled to learn I would only need one injection per month. After my 6th month on Orencia I’m pretty much back to when I was first diagnosed in 2005. My joints feel like they are on fire and I can’t move. I also have a terrible racing heart that keeps me awake with some serious trouble taking deep breaths. I’ve had zero relief while taking this medicine besides maybe a few days right after I take the shot. I suffer for 20-25 days a month. Not good. Was told now to try Rinvoq but after reading reviews on it I don’t plan on trying it. I was taking Enbrel for 14 years prior but was taken off it as I have severe erosion in my bones and holes in my joints. I hope I can find something that works for my pain.,842,2,1;;

The first go around I had a headache and fever and aches for that night and most of the next few days. After the second dose I have severe aches and pains in all joints and muscles and my skin hurts to touch it plus I have a cold or something that just came on a day after the infusion. I am wondering if it is going to work for me or if I need to change. I was on Simponi Aria for a year and a half and then it stopped working. My question is are these symptoms considered bad or something that I have to put up with and hope they go away and the Orencia starts working without these side effects?,645,2,2;;

Abatacept ,Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,29-Jun-23,LKid,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I have rheumatoid arthritis and mixed connective tissue disease. I was on methotrexate and prednisone for approximately 8 years. The methotrexate stopped working and I frequently had severe flare-ups that caused me to increase prednisone to alleviate the severe swelling stiffness and pain. I recently tried Humira injections. They did not work for me. I was tested to see if I would respond to other TNF inhibitors and learned I had less than a ten percent chance that any TNF inhibitor drugs would help. After reviewing various other options offered by my doctor I decided to give Orencia a try. I have completed the 3 loading dose infusions plus one monthly dose. I am pleased to say I feel 80 percent better. The stiffness and severe pain are gone. I can make fists again. Before I couldn't close my hands. My energy is better and I'm sleeping more comfortably because I'm not feeling all the pressure point pain. I'm still on the 5 mg of prednisone but I plan to stop taking it.,983,10,0;;

Abilify,For Bipolar Disorder,24-Aug-20,Andrea,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I've been struggling with bipolar II my whole life and have been hospitalized twice. This last time they put me on abilify in addition to my lamictal and lexapro along with trazadone for sleep. First the side effects. They were pretty bad in the beginning super restless high anxiety couldn't concentrate on anything unless it involved my hands. I did a lot of adult coloring and rearranged my house a few times. I was treated with ativan for about 2 weeks a double dose of trazadone at night and self treated with THC. The side effects are starting to wear off and it's like I can see the world in color! My husband says I'm acting like when we first met and the sparkle is back in my eyes. If you have side effects work with your doctor. I am so glad I did and stayed on this med. It's been a month and totally life changing.,827,8,179;;

I've been taking this medication for over a month & hands down I feel great. Yes I still have my days but,354,10,331;;
Abilify,For Agitated State,6-Aug-20,Hands,6-Aug-20,My 9 year old son started Abilify a week ago. Prior to he was diagnosed with Intermittent Explosive Disorder and possibly ADHD. He has struggled with intense burst of extreme anger. He would yell scream throw things hit himself slam doors etc. He would be angry very quickly over small things. He was very impulsive and had many troubles at school focusing. We tried 2 different ADHD meds with no luck. They actually made things worse. His behaviour changed the moment he started Abilify at a low dose of 2mg a day. We expected weeks until seeing results. My child is a completely different person. He is calm polite and so pleasant. He has voiced his own opinion on feeling this med is working. He can feel the difference within himself. He displays no side effects. He still feels and shows emotions just in a calm manner. We have struggled heartbreakingly for a long time in finding him help with nothing that has actually worked. This has absolutely changed his life.,971,9,168;;

I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and took Abilify until I was 22 under various forms. I used to take two pills a day and ended up eventually taking it from injection at the hospital because it didn't help me at all. I honestly had a feeling things were only getting worse. I was always extremely tired and sleepy. I had some troubles tolerating heat even with very low temperatures outside and excessive salivation. I gained 105 lbs during these years and couldn't move much. As soon as I stopped taking Abilify I got so much better phisically. I contacted a private psychologist and things got better without that therapy.,704,1,11;;

My suicidal panic attacks went away and I felt so much better in just a couple of weeks.

This happened about three times in the span of a few days so I had to stop taking Abilify. If I hadn't had that side effect it probably would've been a decent medication.,509,2,64;;

Abilify ,For Bipolar Disorder,12-Dec-20,BP2Girl,Taken for 1 to 6 months,This was one of the worst medications I’ve ever tried.

I also felt so agitated that it took all my energy to survive the day. It made me hungry but did nothing for depression or hypomania. My eyeballs felt like they were rolling around and I could have just stared at a white wall. Stopping it was like a dream. I took it for a few months. Worst med ever. Totally net negative.

Within a week I did notice an improvement in my mood and motivation. Nothing earth shattering but noticeable. Hoping my doctor will bump me up next time I see him.

My ability dose was 5mg pill per day. From day one that I took it I became incredibly irritated. I felt agitated and restless almost immediately. I was so restless like I was itching from inside my chest and soul I don't know how to describe it. I couldn't eat couldn't feel hungry slept less hours had insomnia felt stressed felt anxious and constantly felt nauseous/stomach pain. The only benefit was that I had intense energy to get up and move but it didn't feel nice. My motivation of getting up was because of how irritated I got when I lay down or rest. Working out would help but never enough the calm down my restlessness. Overall I gave a chance for 1 month (plus a few days of withdrawing it with the assistance of my psychiatrist) and it didn't get any better over time. Horrible experience.,905,2,5;;

But nothing to severe. I take 5mg in the morning and 5mg at night perfect dose for me.

However only three hours later I was sitting on the couch when suddenly my arm lifted up and flung itself over the arm rest. I didn't even feel a muscle twitch. I wouldn't have even known had I not seen it move and felt it flop against the rest. It was bizarre. Two other incidents happened that same night so I called my doctor in a panic who told me not to take the next dose. They took me off it immediately.,505,3,63;;
Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,20-Nov-21,RyRy,Taken for less than 1 month,I was exhausted and depressed with what mimicked chronic fatigue syndrome. I could barely stay awake everyday and getting through the work day was next to impossible. I also counterintuitively had horrible insomnia and took as many non addictive meds such as Serequel Melatonin and Hydroxyzine to get to sleep. Even with these meds I still could barely get to sleep and stay asleep. I started back on my Abilify at 5mg two weeks ago and it’s changed my life. I now naturally wake up everyday at 7(ish) and have cut my sleep meds in half. I don’t take my Hydroxyzine anymore. I sleep throughout the night. I still drink coffee because I like it. But I am drinking 10 times less coffee now. I used to just down coffee in hopes that it would help my chronic fatigue but it was to no avail. I’m not jittery. I’m not wired. I’m just alert and awake. I’m also less depressed.,869,10,16;;

I was just told he is the star student for the month and that has NEVER happened. He is now potentially looking at joining the general population at school.

I finally stopped gaining at 250. I have tried everything to take the weight off. Nothing. My doctor added 20 mg of Lexapro. I gained 30 more pounds. I am going to stop taking the Abilify as the weight gain is causing health issues. I just hope the weight will come off.,393,3,46;;

Abilify ,For Agitated State,23-May-21,Pandy,Taken for less than 1 month,I have been suffering major anxiety and fear since puberty. It got much worse after having a child. After trying SSRIs I felt like a zombie with no motivation. I used to drink alcohol a lot to suppress the anxiety too which lead to tons of problems in my life. Since taking Ambilify I feel like a normal person! I feel like the person I wanted to be. It has increased my appetite a lot and the first week I couldn’t sleep but now after a couple weeks I’m calm and sleeping well. I’m afraid of the weight gain associated with this drug but a few extra pounds is better than crippling anxiety and substance abuse.,611,9,19;;

Abilify ,For Bipolar Disorder,24-Oct-18,Abilify...,24-Oct-18,This drug made my life miserable dumbed me down made me like a zombie. Hardly any thoughts or expression & then the Big one..I couldn’t sit down! The side effect Akathisia which is intense restlessness. sounds like no big deal but it was an everyday every minute struggle I suffered horribly! I’d walk down the street to pass time I’d count hours till the day was over I literally couldn’t sit down I sat to eat and had to stand back up as soon as I stopped chewing. I smoked cigarettes for 8 years and I tried to quit every Sunday turns out that one treatment for Akathisia is nicotine. My doc never picked up on it and I was taking Abilify so long I thought it was just what I had become. When I went off of Abilify I could live again. In almost every way. Not only can I sit down in peace but I can think clearly. I didn’t realize how much it was DUMBING ME DOWN. Don’t take this Just work on yourself take other meds.

Abilify ,For Depression,8-Oct-16,alitl...,Taken for 5 to 10 years,I was diagnosed with depression in 2000. My doctor at the time was a bit of a quack and had no idea of the symptoms and treatments for depression. Moving forward I have been seeing a very good doctor now for about 12 years. As you are well aware not all meds for for all people. I am only writing this today in hopes of saving someone some time and frustration if Abilify is not working for you. I started taking Abilify as an enhancement to the Wellbutrin that I was already taking. As time went on my depression got worse. To make a long story short I went off of Abilify 3 months ago and life has been great. Not sleeping all day or dragging my butt thinking clearer and have endless amounts of energy.

I have been without Depression ever since I started Abilify. I am one happy camper! I have been so resistant to so many medicines. Have been on Lexapro Welbutrin and Trazodone for years. The past year(s) I had this depression that was hovering over me preventing me to feel any enjoyment whatsoever. Well Abilify has allowed me to feel LIFE. I have energy and I even look forward doing things again. The only negative factor is that I enjoy my one cup of coffee a day. Well no more. If I drink a cup I feel as if I drank tons of coffee. Stay away from Caffeine. And I am NOT HUNGRY!,696,9,62;;

Abilify ,For Depression,14-Nov-12,Anonymous,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I have been taking this medication for several months along with Viibryd for depression and anxiety.

Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,30-Dec-19,Mamac,Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Fibromyalgia and MDD. The pain from Fibromyalgia kept me in bed or on the couch out of work and had no interest in socializing. After taking 5 mg of Abilify daily within 2 weeks I was so much happier. I am loving life again. It is a true miracle for me the downside I gained 15 pounds in 6 months. I’m starving myself to not gain anymore and cannot lose 1 pound therefore I rated the drug accordingly.,405,8,24;;
Abilify ,For Borderline Personality Disorder,5-Jan-13,Hsher...,5-Jan-13,Abilify is a miracle for me! I had tried lithium Risperdal Depakote & they never worked. I know it does not work for everyone because everyones brain's are different but it WORKS for me & I am finally the person I have always wanted to be. I actually stop & think rationally in negative situations when I used to react inappropriately with anger & then regret what I said or my actions. I have depression severe anxiety and BiPolar Disorder (because of childhood trauma) and I am happy for the first time in my life. A Dr. prescribed it to me about 4yrs ago & I guess it was fairly new and I did not have insurance at the time so it was going to be $425 (too expensive) for a months supply & didn't get it. That is one of the biggest mistakes of my life so far.,761,10,54;;
Abilify ,For Schizoaffective Disorder,13-Mar-20,Feeli...,13-Mar-20,I have schizophrenia anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder) and depression. I started wellbutrin and abilify 4 days ago and I also take Loxapine. Because I started Wellbutrin and Abilify at the same time I'm not sure which one is working for my anxiety. But it was at a solid 8.6/10 and now it's down to 5.5/10. So whatever Abilify and wellbutrin is doing it's working for my anxiety a lot.,409,8,23;;
Abilify ,For Agitated State,1-Feb-18,quarky,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I was started on this to try to help my misophonia (reaction to sounds such as dripping water chewing snapping gum or repetitive noises such as pencil tapping) after Risperdal (made me feel like a zombie) and Seroquel (just knocked me out) didn't work and I've actually been quite happy with the results.,304,7,33;;

Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,3-Oct-19,Bake,Taken for 5 to 10 years,I love Abilify. I don't remember any side effects from when I started but it was several years ago. I ran out once and didn't renew it on time (don't do this) and my depression went haywire. I was taking two other antidepressants (still am) so I feel like Abilify does most of the heavy lifting. An added bonus of the generic version is that with my insurance it is free every month. I didn't even know that was possible!,421,10,25;;
Abilify ,For Bipolar Disorder,4-May-12,Anonymous,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I'm 38 and have been suffering from bipolar and some schizophrenia since age 12. First time in my life that a pill other than a painkiller took away the crushing pressure pinning my dreams my soul to the ground.,211,10,55;;
Abilify ,For Depression,4-May-12,mgw,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,Abilify has been a lifesaver for me probably literally. I've tried at least a dozen different medications (for the treatment of depression and social anxiety) since I was 16 (I'm now 25) and Abilify has probably shown the biggest improvement of them all. My mood is great most of the time anxiety is reduced and I have a lot more confidence than I used to. The one side effect: weight gain. I'm hungry all the time and have gained 20-30 pounds. Previously my mental health took priority over my physical health because I was so depressed. Now that I'm doing better I may cut back on Abilify in order to get back in better physical health. Hopefully the positive effects won't go away!,684,8,55;;
Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,1-Jun-21,Holly...,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,This is hands down the best medicine. I’ve been taking it for 6 months and it’s changed my life.

I use to have so much anxiety especially with relationships and now I can now hold a healthy relationship and friendships. If you’re considering taking it do it! Only side effect was it made my brain cloudy at first then went away. 10/10.,465,10,16;;

After the first few days I could feel that I was getting better❤️ I had lots of energy a great attitude depression and anxiety is gone❤️ I did have to go from 2 mg to 5 mg because it was seeming less effective and the transition has been good.

Abilify ,For Depression,22-Nov-17,Mac,22-Nov-17,So I went on ability about a year to two years ago and it made me gain 50lbs in less than 6 months. A lot of my depression ties into my self worth and body image issues so gaining so much weight (A long with hundreds of stretch marks) definitely damaged my self worth and thus making my depression worse. Plus I didn't feel like it made any difference in my life whether I took it or not. Worked for 2-4 weeks then quit working,427,1,32;;
Abilify ,For Depression,2-Nov-11,Anonymous,2-Nov-11,Abilify has been a miracle for me. For 14 years I've tried to get relief from major depression and until I got on this medicine nothing else worked. No weight gain a little side effect. My biggest gripe TOO MUCH ENERGY. ,220,10,55;;

His dose went from 1ml to 10ml over two weeks and his behaviour spiralled out of control with every increase. He just went from bad to worse to horrific. He couldn’t control his thoughts! He became uncontrollably aggressive and wanted to hurt himself. We ended up phoning Emergancy Pediatrics and they put him back onto Risperidone and everything returned to normal. This is an awful medication.,444,1,23;;

Abilify ,For Depression,5-Nov-13,Charles...,5-Nov-13,I took it for a few months and felt like a zombie. I've been dealing with stress and for some lame ass reasons a health care shrink diagnosed me as bi-polar. All who know me would say that's a load of crock. Hydrocodone/Vicadon/Vallum works well with me but no Dr.s want to perscribe it to me. They are afraid I will abuse it. I've never abused any medication nicotine alcholol etc. in all my 56 years on this planet. I just know what I need/want/enjoy for the time I need it. It won't fix my problems but It certainly helps me fix my problems. Lately I've been getting Vicodon off the street. I take one a day. (7.5 mg) ...occasionally two. I am more positive and one by one am getting those pesky stressful situations out of my life.,735,1,45;;

But anxiety and depression started creeping out some more slowly and I just couldn't handle how I was feeling especially being a mother to a 6 year old boy. 2 weeks ago my doctor recommended Abilify at a very low dose to add on with my Cymbalta in which I was iffy about it and gave it some time to think about if I wanted to take it. Today is my third day taking this medication and I'm on a minimal dose at 1mg. I have been taking it in the morning and yesterday... I noticed a major positive difference within myself. I felt increasingly energized I felt more motivated.,986,10,16;;
Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,16-Jan-20,Ran...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,Abilify was great for depression but the side effects were unreal. I was on Abilify for 2 months and had gained 30 pounds. That was about 3 months ago. I'm still trying to lose the weight and find a good med for my depression and anxiety. I wouldn't suggest Abilify just because it makes you crave like crazy and there are other meds out there that won't give you crazy cravings!,379,3,21;;
Abilify ,For Bipolar Disorder,15-Oct-14,Valky...,15-Oct-14,Have been on Abilify for two weeks and my personality has changed drastically. I went from being chilled out and quite okay on Seroquel and Effexor but wanted to try Abilify to combat weight gain. In the two weeks I've been on it I've swung from hypomanic to aggressive and downright selfish. I did things I wouldn't normally do that has hurt my relationship with my partner and I've also been spending like crazy. Probably should stop but will consult psychiatrist first to see what she says.,493,1,41;;

Abilify ,For Depression,14-Sep-21,Emma,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I was on Cipralex and it did virtually nothing. Before I went on pills I told my doctor I was hesitant on starting any sort of pill because I had worked really hard for 1.5 years to get in shape and was worried about weight gain. My doctor put me on cipralex it did nothing so she added Abilify. Within 3 months I had gained over 28 pounds. Zero diet change no lifestyle changes I was just packing on the pounds week by week. After looking in the mirror and seeing what I have physically become I have never felt more disgusted by my appearance. I immediately stopped taking the abilify and the weight gain pretty much stopped in its tracks. Taking abilify has been the biggest regret of my life all of the work I did on myself was down the drain within 3 months. I went off them and I have not been able to lose the weight since. It has been 4 months of extreme dieting but nothing helps. I'm overweight again. This has started a bunch of new mental/body issues I wish I could give it a 0,989,1,13;;

I'm myself again but I'm not quite the same. I've gained weight 30 plus pounds and I've been on the drug for 3 years. I tried going off of it to 300 and the side effects were my moodiness returned...

Abilify is the reason I can lead a normal life without hearing other auditory voices and seeing holographic figures. Please at least give Abilify a try if you share these symptoms. I have heard from other people that share my symptoms that Abilify works for them too! Always in addition to another prescription as I understand it. I wish you all the best in your journey to find peace. Keep hope alive! You can do this and be happy if Abilify works for you too. Everyone is different so be willing to try and you’ll find the prescription that works for you too. Abilify is amazing for many!,819,10,7;;

Abilify ,For Depression,25-Apr-23,griev...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,Not one antidepressant ever worked after a major trauma in my family. Then after being blown up by an explosive accident I had to regroup and head the household again. One week after starting the lowest dose of this medicine the constant weeping stopped the hope came back the clear thinking started again the planning for the future started the COVID pandemic waned and I felt fearless. Before this medication I could barely leave the house to even drive to the doctor's office which is in a very bad neighborhood and high crime district. Now I feel like Look out 'cause here I come and you'd better get out of my way! Since your neurotransmitters are working properly on this medicine you don't need to be on anything to slow them down from short-circuiting such as tranquilizers and the medication stops the brain from what we call ping pong balling so you can focus and get tasks finished.,893,9,3;;
Abilify ,For Bipolar Disorder,1-Apr-21,Madonna,Taken for less than 1 month,I was prescribed 2mg of Abilify to take for being diagnosed with bipolar depression. I started with half the tablet in the morning and omg! I felt sleepy the first day and somewhat disoriented. I felt that anxious feeling you get with new meds hours later. At night lights were so bright to me and it also gave me insomnia. Second and third days were worse with side effects. I almost dialled 911. I was perspiring felt lightheaded and extremely weak. It made me feel paranoid. Had a panic attack and the rest of the day I felt as if I drank 6 cups of coffee. Never again! Bye Abilify!,585,1,15;;

Abilify ,For Bipolar Disorder,5-Apr-13,myste...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I would hide at home for months shaking when a telephone rang. I couldn't let people go and had obsessive thoughts. Abilify gave me calm confidence and hope. It made me less sensitive to light and time I was no longer at the mercy of each passing moment. I woke up relaxed went to bed without a noise in my head inner voices stopped criticizing me thoughts didn't race. I was creative but focused and began wonderful new projects. Had NO side effects- NO weight gain. 'Worked magic that first day. But after a month it seemed to do nothing but make me sad. Evidently that was a manic phase. It blocks my mania but not my depressive switch. Feels like I've traded manic depression for unipolar depression. I am being switched to lithium.,736,6,45;;

Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,1-Feb-20,Lucy,Taken for 1 to 2 years,Within the first few days I could feel Abilify working to lift my depression giving me more optimism and energy. However at my starting dose of 5 mg I had restless legs both during the day and at night. A lowered dose of 2 mg worked great for a few months but now it’s ineffective (this is the dose I’m currently on). My psychiatrist had me increase the dose but I didn’t feel any effects so she put me back down to 2 mg. I’m also taking Adderall and I notice if I skip a dose of Abilify and then take Adderall I get really bad anxiety as the Adderall wears off. So right now it’s kind of a neutral medication for me.,617,7,20;;

It did nothing to help the depression the anhedonia is still there which is what it was supposed to help with. I also gained 10 pounds in 3 weeks and felt a constant appetite which is typical of anti psychotic. My advice to anyone with depression is use medication only as a last resort. After diet exercise and therapy and all other things you can try and that's where I'm at now is what will I do to battle my anhedonia and feel normal again. Well after years of trying med after med I'm done with medicine .,606,1,12;;

She started taking abilify when she was 5 years old due to massive tantrums. It was a miracle when she started taking it. When she was 8 years old I asked the dr to change her medication because she seemed to have developed a tolerance and it no longer was working as well. At first I didn’t see how downhill it sent her. She wasn’t throwing the tantrums anymore. But for the first time she started having major problems at school. Not with her behavior so much as her lack of self control. She was singing or humming and completely unable to focus. It took going to a new dr to get her back on after 4 years off of it. The difference is again life changing.

Abilify ,Not Mentioned,26-Sep-19,sammy...,Taken for 2 to 5 years,20 years ago I became mentally ill. I went from being a sensible drinker to a raging alcoholic.

Finally I met a DR who put me on Abilfy injections and Sertraline and together they wiped out my alcoholism and mental illness lock stock and barrel That was several years ago . I now drink normally and have no sign of mental illness. I'm in a happy relationship. I have no idea what Abilify did to my brain but it could not have worked any better than if the scientists designed it just for me. I am broken hearted that I did not get this drug 20 years ago.

My psychiatrist put me on Lamictal first and it gave me hives. Then we tried trileptal and the GI side effects were unbearable after 2 weeks. Finally she put me on Abilify and so far it has been great. I’ve been on 2 mg of Abilify (with 50 mg Zoloft) for a week and there have been almost no side effects. I was warned there might be dry mouth or excessive sweating but I’ve been fine. It did cause me to wake up 7-8 times during the night but I switched to taking it in the morning and now I sleep like a baby again!

Zoloft for depression and Clondine to manage my complete rage. My moods were out of control. I was depressed and hopeless one second and then mean irrational and full of rage the next. My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I'm not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle.

Then I was put on Lamictal (which I would also give a 10 star rating to). It made my anxiety and panic attacks vanish. However I still felt empty. Like I had no purpose. My doctor finally put me on a low dose of Abilify. It helped so much. It made a world of a difference in my life. I am SCARED to die now when before I only wished I'd die. I take 15 mg now and it is amazing. I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't had luck with traditional antidepressants.,726,10,32;;
Abilify ,For Depression,2-Feb-22,InSha...,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,At first Abilify seemed like a miracle. I felt more energy and while it didn’t eliminate my depression it kept me going to work and at least functional for myself and my family. 70 lbs of weight gain later I attempted to go off of the medication. I was left with a severe resting tremor and excruciating neuropathy that feels like is destroying my life. I am unable to work and barely able to leave my bed. I cannot care for my children sleep and am losing weight rapidly due to a non existent appetite. I am truly scared for my life after taking this drug.,557,1,10;;
Abilify ,For Bipolar Disorder,9-Apr-16,NHelm,Taken for 1 to 6 months,Abilify is the only antipsychotic that works for me. The extreme hunger lethargy restlessness and memory problems I had on other antipsychotics are nonexistent with abilify. I was in the middle of a severe depressive episode when I took it and it only took several weeks for me to be back to normal functioning. I sleep better have more energy and fewer mood swings. This medication is great. I find that it is more activating while other drugs in the same class like Zyprexa are more tranquilizing.,499,9,32;;
Abilify ,For Depression,18-Jul-16,Wired...,18-Jul-16,This is one dangerous drug as for me it made me feel half dead to me and the world around me it made my depression even worse and anxiety really bad to the point I was unable to do the things I wanted to enjoy. Was unable to settle..It put me in a dark place and gave me really bad dreams and good luck if on it more than 6months to come off may the force be with you it's a horrific experience so please keep clear!,416,1,31;;

Abilify ,For Bipolar Disorder,23-Nov-19,Whaddup,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I was prescribed Abilify after experiencing a 3-4 month long hypomanic episode. I was on Lamictal 100mg but that wasn’t helping alone so my psychiatrist decided to add in Abilify. She also said it would help with the mild paranoid thoughts I was having. This was a horrible medication for me personally. It may work for other people but it wasn’t for me. It made me flat and I didn’t care about anything anymore. I wasn’t depressed on it I just didn’t care about anything. Even the people around me commented on how apathetic I had become. It made my fears of psychiatric medications come true. I lost my personality passion and energy. I am off of it now and feel way better. I think it served its purpose of getting me out of my hypomanic episode which is why I gave it a 4-star rating but I couldn’t see being on this medication long-term.,842,4,19;;
Abilify ,For Bipolar Disorder,3-Oct-18,Wilmar,Taken for less than 1 month,I felt like a different person. I felt weird socially with drawn and introverted. I had fogginess in the back of my head. I had no appetite or sex drive. I had shaky legs and hands. I was up all night. I would have times where my eyes were out of focus and I couldn’t see straight. Please do not take this medication. Everybody is different but my experience was horrible. As I stopped taking it these side effects are going away. I couldn’t function or do simple tasks.,470,1,23;;
Abilify ,For Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,18-Jul-12,Anonymous,18-Jul-12,I have been on Abilify for about 5 months now. It works wonders for my OCD but it makes me restless and non-emotional. It might sound good to not be emotional but when I say that I mean happiness too. It numbs me. I have also gained 15 pounds and so I am coming off the medicine slowly.,286,5,43;;
Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,6-Aug-22,Randi...,Taken for 1 to 2 years,Has helped depression greatly. At 5mg dose 1st week only slept 8 hours whole week. Dose went up to 7.5 mg and I started getting 7 hours of sleep a night. I look forward to things now and am not sleeping 16 hours a day from depressed exhaustion. So give it time to level off before giving up due to anxiety or sleeplessness. I am having some anxiety but no panic attacks and experienced some larger chunks of memory loss yesterday so am decreasing my dose after year and half on Abilify. Would not like to have to stop taking it but there are other meds out there. I have been thru a lot though.,594,9,7;;
Abilify ,For Depression,14-Jul-09,Anonymous,14-Jul-09,Two weeks since I started abilify 5mg I can now get out of bed and enjoy my life. I am up at 4am but so is my dad and 4 dogs which makes me go to bed early. But throughout the day. I am a totally new and fun person. I hope it lasts.,232,8,51;;

Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,10-Dec-18,kelly...,10-Dec-18,Since starting Abilify (in combo with Lamictal) I find that my depression both the major and mild symptoms is gone! On just Lamictal it was mild but still there. Now it's as if it's been wiped out. Hope this lasts as I haven't been on the drug very long. I also have mood swings and impulsivity issues so I think it helps with that too. Now I'm just waiting for something for my OCD and attention issues.,404,10,22;;

Abilify ,For Schizophrenia,27-Jul-13,momie,27-Jul-13,My now 23 yr old son has been on Abilify since may 2012. Initially on Clozapine but way too zonked. His history is recreational cannabis use caused a psychotic break. Not smoking now or intending to.,199,10,39;;
Abilify ,For Agitated State,5-Aug-09,MacKat,5-Aug-09,I took this medication in addition to Zoloft 100mg. My doctor had me on it as a mood stabilizer at 5mg a day. I don't have bipolar disorder but had some manic or agitated behavior at the time (which could've been caused by the Zoloft). Doctor prescribed it and thought it would help. It increased my energy and I began to workout more. For some reason I woke up early every morning around 8AM while I was on Abilify. I'm not a morning person so that's really early for me. Also I felt speeded up overly confident and optimistic. I had to stop taking it because I experienced odd involuntary tongue movements. I was also on Seroquel which is in the same family of drugs as Abilify so the doctor thought the combination is what caused the odd effect.,748,6,50;;
Abilify ,For Depression,14-Sep-21,MMW,Taken for less than 1 month,I've been on Zoloft & Wellbutrin for years. I've switched have always been hesitant to try any kind of antipsychotics. But my Dr. Said let's try it for a month before changing all other meds. It's only been a week and I can't describe how much better I feel. I have major depression w/ panic attack & insomnia now on this med I've slept now without any sleeping pills and I don't feel drugged my energy level is up. It's amazing. I can wait to tell her my Dr. I'm so grateful I tried it. I used to be on another antipsychotic & it was a feeling of being drugged & foggy. I don't have any of those side effects. Nor has my hunger increased. If you're are feeling depressed hopeless & suicidal ask your Dr about it please. Good luck.,731,10,11;;
Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,11-Sep-21,south...,Taken for 1 to 2 years,I am on 10 mg of Abilify and to say that it's helped me is an understatement. It has given me my life back! I am excited when I wake up mind you I used to not be a morning person well now I am! I take 10 mg tab at night and I wake up feeling refreshed happy and ready to take on the day! No side effects for me! I absolutely love Abilify! All of my intrusive lonely depressing and suicidal thoughts have disappeared! It feels like how I looked at life when I was a child happy and worry free! My thoughts are organized I am able to function as a person wife daughter and mother.

Abilify ,For Depression,2-Nov-10,bedhead,2-Nov-10,A miracle medicine for me. I take it with Effexor XR 100mg I immediately felt relief from my depression and anxiety. I had more energy than I knew what to do with (bordering restlessness though) no side effects except for the ants in the pants feeling. Tried several different medications and this is by far the best. The samples were great I just hope I can afford to pay for it...I hope it helps you like it's helped me.,422,10,46;;

Adderall ,For ADHD,22-Oct-19,Miket...,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin Lamictal and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However as my tolerance increased the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.,470,9,30;;

Abilify ,For Bipolar Disorder,21-May-19,Jules,Taken for 2 to 5 years,I was on this for over 3 years. To start with I thought it was working the last year I had a racing head and high anxiety. Was discharged from psych so had to fight to get seen again to change medication. Realised a few months after coming off it that my fices had changed shortly after starting Abilify and not in a good way. I was never in debt before Abilify. I am 37 too. I’m in a lot of debt because of Abilify because I started taking out loans shortly after starting it amongst other things. Have since read that the FDA made the manufacturing company to list compulsive shopping compulsive gambling and other excessive behaviours etc as a side effect in May 2016. I started it in August 2015 so was unaware when I researched this medication when I first went on it. No Dr made me aware of this side effect at any point. Please note I have been manic prior to this medication and had never taken out credit or borrowed money.,932,1,20;;

Abilify ,For Depression,18-Feb-22,xfree...,Taken for less than 1 month,I will not have enough space to share all of the horrifying side effects. My resting heart rate went from 64 to 100 on day one. Stomach pain was intolerable. Constipation. Agitation. Brain fog. Hallucinations constantly seeing bugs that weren't there. Exhaustion. 20 lb weight gain in 3 weeks. Intense food and cigarette cravings. Terrifying and vivid nightmares. Wanting to attempt suicide after 3 weeks on very low dose and Dr. told me to stop the meds. Most horrifying side effects I've ever had on a pill. Coming off the med after 3 weeks was a nightmare too.,563,1,9;;
Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,12-Jul-22,Dan,Taken for 1 to 6 months,Abilify was great at first. Anxiety and obsessive and ruminating thoughts slowed down a lot for the first month on 2mg. Once my dose was increased to 4mg everything went downhill. I developed anhedonia and worse anxiety. Even after I dropped my dose for a few months things didn't get better. I stopped taking Abilify and just when I thought things couldn't get worse they did. Within a week of stopping I developed severe insomnia anxiety and an insidious inner restlessness. The anhedonia has also remained 2 months later. I would gladly go back to the depression that abilify was prescribed to treat in exchange to be done with the lasting negative effects of abilify. Please do not take this for MDD and please do not stop taking it suddenly if you are already on it.,771,1,7;;

I never went over 15 mg. I'm currently taking 2.5 mg & I find it quite effective. I did gain some weight 15lb at the beginning but your mental health is very important.

I'm 145lbs with muscle weight and I'm quite happy im planning on some abs thus Abilify hasn't stopped me. It's all in your head.

At first the doctors put me on 10mg which I hated because the dose was too high ( thinking about it now) . Then my doctor raised it to 20mg which was just making me even more emotionless. So I switched back to risperidone consta (injection) but I've always hated risperidone consta so I thought my life was over. But then I noticed I had a full pack of abilify left over from before. So I decided to take just small dose of Abilify along side the risperidone consta and guess what? The Abilify is great at such a small dose. It completely blocks the side effects of risperidone and I can live a greater life now. So I take,684,10,26;;

He can focus and concentrate without getting distracted every few minutes and his meltdowns have decreased so much that he rarely has any. Before the medication he was having meltdowns at least 5 times a day and was frustrated and irritable.

It's been a roller coaster ride especially after gaining 10 pounds in the hospital while taking risperidone and Depakote. I'm still on the Depakote though I hope to discontinue it as soon as my psychiatrist allows but I just switched to Abilify. I've got to say so far I have no complaints. With risperidone I had no lid to my hunger. It was endless and that was quite disappointing. There were many other side effects but the weight gain has added to my self loathing. Though the painful heart dysrhythmias are a close second. I'm hoping that Abilify makes it possible for me to curb my appetite back to what it used to be as I exercise the 30 pounds I don't need away.,730,7,31;;

After years of severe depression the fog has lifted. No more mood swings related to borderline personality disorder. No more irritability/anger. My motivation has increased significantly as well.

That was a warm welcome after 25 years of on and off anti-depressant poop-out! However I am most certain that it has caused weight gain! I do not EVER weigh myself (past eating disorder issue) but my clothes are tighter around the waist. BUT I AM NOT EATING ANY DIFFERENTLY! In fact I have made a concerted effort to eat less but nothing seems to give! Is it fluid? I'm baffled! Yes I'm 43 now but my metabolism wouldn't come to a screeching halt so quickly would it?,698,8,38;;
Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,18-Jun-14,Anonymous,Taken for 1 to 2 years,I was put on Ability to help with Major Depression/Clinical depression and anxiety. The side effects were life changing. Just horrible. I was put on it at 15. I had hallucinations pass out spells times of absolute carelessness and increased suicidal thoughts. I also became very hateful and paranoid. I developed unexplained muscle twitches so my doctor finally took me off of it. I also had constant migraines and increased irritability I was just a mess on this medication! I still have the muscle twitches and it's been 5 years since I had Abilify.,551,1,32;;

Abilify ,For Agitated State,2-Dec-16,anony...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,It did lots of bad things to me. Increased anger . sometimes when upset just pick up a mug and smash it. Could not control it. Also was violent with some one at least twice. Kicked a hole in the wall in hospital . jumped out of moving car. Found it hard to stay in one spot for long . probably had akathisia.,308,1,25;;
Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,23-Nov-21,Anonymous,Taken for 1 to 2 years,I've never been diagnosed as Schizophrenic but this made me paranoid and delusional. Strong twitching and noticeable jerking movements intense anger frustration anxiety unwanted intrusive thoughts weight gain and various other symptoms. In response my psychiatrist increased the dose of aripiprazole and added additional meds to combat the symptoms. I stopped seeing friends stopped attending events I had been going to on a weekly basis for years. Eventually I couldn't even go into a grocery store. 2 days after discontinuing aripiprazole (with new doc's blessing) I landed in a psychiatric ward. It never occurred to me that it was the medication's side effects and not me my mind my inability to just put on my big girl pants and deal with life. Approx 6 years since then and my mind is not the same I'm not the same. The fallout is real. Then I was working full time just promoted and in school. Now I'm on disability. It works for some but please proceed with caution.,974,1,9;;

Abilify ,For Schizoaffective Disorder,16-Sep-18,Medhead,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I have been taking 15 mg of Abilify for 2 months. I’ve lost 6 kg and feel amazing. My depression is all but gone my day to day tasks seem easy now in comparison to my previous med (Risperdal) where I gained 15 kg and was lethargic and unmotivated all the time. I also developed very high prolactin levels from the Risperdal which have now returned to normal since starting Abilify. My symptoms are gone and I feel free for first time in 10 years. I’ve previously been on olanzapine and sodium valproate and like I said Risperdal. Over the last 2 years on those meds I gained 42 kg mostly on olanzapine even with a healthy diet. Now its,635,10,20;;
Abilify ,For Autism,14-Mar-23,Hannah,Taken for 2 to 5 years,It was awful. I was on it on/off from age 13 to 20. It made my depression worse there were days I would come home from school and start crying even when school was going really well for me. I also gained a lot of weight (about 60 lbs total) despite living in a household that served healthy portions and encouraged exercise. It helped short-term with impulse control when I was getting in trouble at school and had anger issues but the pros definitely didn’t outweigh the cons. I’ve also noticed doctors tend to give it out to kids as young as 6 years old who have autism or bipolar or even just have a troubled life. They hand it out like candy. This needs to stop.,666,3,3;;
Abilify ,For Depression,18-Dec-17,Alyssa...,Taken for less than 1 month,I only took this medication once. Within an hour after I took my 2mg pill (also with 20mg lexapro) at around 9-10pm I started to feel incredibly nauseous to the point where it was almost unbearable. I went out on a short car ride with a friend and had to stop because I started vomiting right in my hands and then I threw up for about 5 minutes on the curb feeling super terrible. My friend was almost about to call an ambulance because I just looked that messed up. When I got dropped off at home I still felt incredibly nauseous. I laid on the floor for 3 hours straight CONSTANTLY projectile vomiting until around 2:30am. Yes I ran out of things to throw up and had to force myself to throw up and eat to make myself feel better.,732,1,22;;

Abilify ,For Agitated State,15-Jan-21,EMor,Taken for less than 1 month,I was put on this many years ago for a nervous breakdown and it started to help almost instantly. It was a good add on to my anti depressants at the time. I was literally only on it two weeks and doc decided I didn't need it anymore. It worked a lot better than any other things I've been on over the years. No side effects,323,8,12;;

Abilify ,For Depression,25-Feb-20,Sonny,Taken for less than 1 month,I was on Abilify a grand total of 10 days before I had to stop. It’s hard to describe how anxious/claustrophobic/panicky/nauseous I felt in that short about of time. My suicidal thoughts spiked due to the intensity of the fever dream-like delirium. It felt like I was trapped on a roller coaster inside my own head nauseous and ready to hurl yet I couldn’t get off. I guess you could say my depression subsided but that’s because my mind simply couldn’t focus on anything besides how horrendous I felt.,502,2,149;;

Abilify ,For Depression,10-Jan-16,Texas...,10-Jan-16,I've been suffering with dibilitating depression anxiety and OCD for over 20 years. I've was in remission for 8 years but this time it came back with a vengeance! I was really losing hope. I have tried every single antidep out there and the ones that worked very well before don't work anymore. I've been on a roller coaster and fighting for over 7 years to get my life back. It's been a living hell. I could hardly get out of bed taking a shower was too much even putting my seatbelt on seemed like a chore. If you have ever suffered you know what I'm talking about! I was put on Abilify to help with my Effexor just three days ago and I already feel like I can conquer the world...I just pray it lasts! ,705,9,250;;
Abilify ,For Depression,26-Jun-14,Johnson,26-Jun-14,I was really hesitant to take Abilify after being on Zoloft and later Wellbutrin without noticing effects but I did anyways and within a few days I started noticing effects. I feel surprisingly good now. I find myself doing chores like washing dishes or my laundry and realize that usually I would just slump around saying I'll do it tomorrow until I'm nearly out of clean clothes or dishes. I find myself singing to songs on the radio and my mood is not only noticeably better -- but remarkably and incredibly better.,518,10,287;;
Abilify ,For Major Depressive Disorder,17-Jun-20,Eano,Taken for less than 1 month,Have never ever left a review on anything before but this drug Abilify has helped me so much so far. Was out of work struggling to meet my basic functions necessary to live. I am now feeling like I can actually do things. I also suffer from anxiety and this has helped me so much with social anxiety/ physical symptoms from anxiety. Have been looking for a drug that will work for the past 5 years as I am treatment resistant. Give this a try people please!!,458,9,125;;
Abilify ,For Depression,10-Jun-21,HRubio,Taken for less than 1 month,I have been on 2mg of Abilify on top of 450mg Wellbutrin XL for two weeks now… have been on Wellbutrin for a decade and it never seemed to truly nip my MDD down. Let me tell you I’m the angry irritable kind of depressed person and it has helped me quite a lot thus far but I’m increasing up to 5mg tomorrow. I’m excited to just take the medication because I know it helps me and I’m so stoked to go to 5mg!,406,10,94;;

Abilify ,For Bipolar Disorder,18-Oct-19,Anony...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,I feel like a new woman on Abilify! I have Bi-Polar II anxiety depression and PTSD. I have tried Lithium (gained too much weight and my thyroid went wacky) Lamictal (skin rash) and Topamax (which I currently take 50 mg at night to counteract the possible side effect of weight gain with Abilify). I have NOT gained any weight on Abilify! I was hesitant to take it and now I’m kicking myself for not starting it sooner because I feel amazing! I have energy depression and anxiety are GONE and my bi-polar symptoms have vanished. This is a miracle drug for me! Give it a try if you are questioning it because I wish I would have tried it sooner! I’m 46 years old and I am 5’10” and weigh 165 pounds with a BMI of 24 (Average).,724,10,136;;
Abilify ,For Autism,24-Apr-20,Jolly...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,My young adult autistic son has recently began taking Abilify at 2ml liquid per day and it is nothing short of a miracle. We have had years of aggression.. hitting biting and smashing our home. He is still the same autistic boy with his usual traits but the aggression is GONE. Tried respiridol previously which did nothing so don't give up... different meds work for different people. Has been taking this for 6 weeks so far.,426,10,121;;
